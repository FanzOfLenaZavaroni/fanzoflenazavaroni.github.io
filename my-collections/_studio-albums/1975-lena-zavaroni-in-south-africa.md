<hr>
<p></p>
<p>I had asked if anyone could confirm if this was a studio album or a complation of tracks from her first two albums as you can see from some of the <a href="#comments">Comments</a> below I have decided that the album is must likely a studio album and so I have edited this page to refect that point of view.</p>

{: .clear}

Lena made two personal appearances at Game Discount World, Durban, South Africa where she signed copies of the Album.
* 28 April 1975 at 12.30 pm, at the Smith Street branch.
* 29 April 1975 at 3.30pm, at the Ornance Road branch.

**Note:** The stores had been open for 5 years in 1975 when Lena made her appearances at the stores.

That is why the advert about Lena had "5 Years Young" with the large 5 also being used as the G in the word Game (5ame).
