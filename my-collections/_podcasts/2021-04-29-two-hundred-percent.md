<blockquote>On this week’s This Is Our Everest, your intrepid heroes are at the beach for the BBC’s Seaside Special from August 1975. It affords them ample opportunity to explore their relationship with light entertainment, as all the while Tony Blackburn fights for his life against the cruel tides of the English Channel. Fortunately for everyone involved he was rescued by the Royal Navy just in time, allowing the tragic life and death of Lena Zavaroni to test Ian’s faith in God and children telling jokes test Edward’s, only for a lousy golf-based comedian to challenge him yet further. Roy Hudd chastises the elderly, there’s a slightly incongruous appearance by a music hall legend and once again we ask the poignant question: was there any real need for the creation of Orville the duck?</blockquote>
