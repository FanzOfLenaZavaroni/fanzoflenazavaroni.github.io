It's a shame that things have come to this, the so called official sites know that stolen content is being posted on their  pages and allow it, readers of those pages know that the photographs have been taken from another site yet still give likes to the stolen content.

I still hope to keep adding content, but having to make the site text-only wasn’t part of my original plan. Some things are just hard to post when all you have is an image and limited details—especially when the image itself can’t be used.

Sadly, there are people who only care about photos, treating Lena more like a product than a real person. That’s why they think the so-called official websites are great—because they focus on pictures, not real content. They don’t seem to care about copyright or fair use, which is what we all rely on since none of us own the rights to these images. In their minds, if we don’t own the copyright, then we have no right to complain—but that doesn’t make it okay.

I still want to carry on with this website, but honestly, my interest is fading. More and more, it feels like the fantasy version of Lena is what people want, instead of actually telling her real story.

I haven’t seen Lena the Musical, but from what I’ve heard, it didn’t focus much on the real facts of her life. I also haven’t watched the BBC Scotland documentary yet—I worry it might be more about protecting Victor’s image than showing the full truth about Lena’s life. I’d like to believe he was just naïve, but I’m not sure. I suppose I should give it a chance at some point—maybe I’ll see him in a different light.

At the end of the day, I want this site to respect Lena’s story, not just be another place that adds to the fantasy version of her life. Whether I keep going or end up archiving it, my goal has always been to make sure people see her as a real person, not just a collection of photos.

As always thanks for your ongoing support it means a lot,

Regards Robert (Robcamstone).

I wonder if this was because Lena's parents lived in Rothesay and therefore her work permits were granted by Strathclyde council.  He might have had to take the contract to them so that they could approve it and issue a permit. Perhaps it was faster for him to sign it and forward it to Harold Fielding than to send it to Dorothy Solomon first who would then sign it and send it to Harold Fielding.

I's a shame that they can't  indicate in the programme summary that they are airing a shortened version without Lena and some other artistes.

#### Replies

**FanzOfLenaZavaroni** (2024-06-09T09:29:30Z)

Sorry for the delay in replying.

There is no reason why they could not add an indicator to inform visitors to their website that the episodes being broadcast are the shortened versions of TOTP but that would take a level of caring that the BBC does not have.

An indicator of some sort must be active within the code that powers their website for iPlayer to know which version to provide to viewers so that same indicator could also add " (Shortened Version)" to the end of the programme title that would be better than nothing but I think a separate page would be better after all they have a separate page for TOTP2 and as all the current broadcasts of TOTP are all  shortened we the paying public should know what is actually being shown.

Their laziness makes it very hard for anyone wishing to make an archive of broadcast content that is accurate.

TOTP, [...Sings Neil Diamond](https://fanzoflenazavaroni.github.io/2010-11-14-sings-neil-diamond/#infobox3), [The Morecambe And Wise Show](https://fanzoflenazavaroni.github.io/1976-02-11-the-morecambe-and-wise-show/) all have misleading information along with many other programmes.

At the bottom of the stairs that Lena is walking up with Philip Solomon in Blackpool, at the bottom right is a girl with a dark skirt and white top. I wonder if this is her friend Susie Heckler.
Unfortunately GitHub won't let me copy the photo to here, but I'm sure you know which one I mean.

**FanzOfLenaZavaroni** (2024-04-14T12:46:27Z)

I recently sent a batch command to delete all unused images on the  GitHub repository for Fanz Of LZ and a batch command to delete all versioning history so that the content Thieves could not take them. If It's the photo I am thinking of then it would be one of the photos deleted as I had a number of photos on the repository ready to be used at a later date but have now removed them all for reasons that we both know about which would be why I'm guessing the sharing of it here would not work.

I think I know the photo you mean. If it's OK with you I will re-scan my physical copy and post it on your Facebook Page and we could see what others think about the girl, I have yet to scan it but I would say Yes it's Susie Heckler.

**FanzOfLenaZavaroni** (2024-04-14T13:20:03Z)

I just finished a scan and did a HD Scan on the girl as we thought she was it is a young woman I would say so not Susie Heckler maybe Ellis Gilmer but maybe too young for her.

The beginning and the ending have appeared on TV Ark, no footage of Lena, but she is listed on the closing credits.
https://tvark.org/crackerjack-4

**FanzOfLenaZavaroni** (2023-12-18T00:31:10Z)

Thanks for the link at least it confirms we have the right date for the episode in which Lena was on.

I just checked out the [BFI Collections Website](https://collections-search.bfi.org.uk/web/Details/ChoiceFilmWorks/150575327) seem that they only have a copy on VHS and they have yet to add who the guests on the show were only listing the regular cast members.

Searching of the BFI Collections is very unreliable in the end to get anything to come up I had to search by just "Crackerjack" and then go through the results myself to find the episode and sadly the way the data is presented means its currently not possible to link to a specific section of the content.

Using Google or Microsoft Bing to do a site search is also disappointing as very few results show up I would have thought that as the BFI Collections Website has been running for over a year now more of its content would have been crawled by the search engines but the limit may also be due to the poor coding structure of the BFI site as the search results all look very much the same which may be leading the search engines to ignore most of the content treating it all as duplicates, rant over!       

#### Replies

**StephenMolloy1** (2023-12-18T01:05:04Z)

The BFI seem to have nearly everything she appeared in, The problem seems to be that a lot of it is in obsolete formats and by the look of things it is going to take them years to convert them.

**FanzOfLenaZavaroni** (2023-12-18T12:08:56Z)

I'm hoping the fact that the BFI states that this Videotape can be requested for access means that a currently unlisted format is in their archive (They have a disclaimer that not all details have been added to the Collections website and that details will be added as and when possible and that details may not be free of errors).

Yes! it's great to know most of Lena's TV work is archived but sadly for how much Longer The VHS players are not going to function indefinitely and an archive of unplayable content is pretty much pointless. This is why fan owned content is so important to Lena's legacy.

### WAFFLE:
As the BFI was created around the same time as the BBC it must mean they have a mass of content that is in need of preservation and sadly some of it will become lost over time due to the large amount of it and the cost of preservation. While we fans want to see Lena's shows not only preserved but ideally made available to watch in our homes. The reality is other content is going to be considered of more value before many shows including Lena's.

Sadly the BBC has no legal obligation to maintain an archive, the only obligation the BBC have is that if they do not want to keep a copy of a programme themselves they must offer a copy to the BFI and the BFI will decide if they want to take up the offer or not.

It has always made me question why the BFI was not named "The British Film & Television Institute" but I guess back when the BBC and BFI were set-up all TV was on film plus it meant if TV was a flop the BFI could go on archiving films without the need to rename.


**StephenMolloy1** (2023-12-18T12:57:27Z)

Even fewer radio shows seem to have been recorded, which is a shame as she did a lot on Radio 2, and some local radio interviews in places like Blackpool.

**FanzOfLenaZavaroni** (2023-12-18T13:40:45Z)

Yes! Radio seems to get over looked the BBC does have an archive of Radio content but a list of what it has is not ready available. Some content is listed on the [Radio - BBC Archive](https://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/radio/z6cqgwx#:~:text=Since%202008%20the%20BBC's%20Radio,million%20recordings%20and%20growing%20daily.) The British Library Sound Archive also has Radio Broadcasts Archived but what it has I don't know and at this time the website is of line, but heres the link anyway: [BL radio-broadcast-recordings](https://www.bl.uk/collection-guides/radio-broadcast-recordings).

Sites like mixcloud would be our best option to get to hear Lena related content but to date I have yet to find anything on there apart from what you and I have both found which is the "Top 20 with Tom Browne" and some of them have been taken down.

Thanks for the link gave me a reason to start creating individual pages for each version of a single I had already started on the Studio Albums. 

It should help reduce the data load for mobile users and makes an "On This Day" more clear as to which of the versions of a Single/Album the "On This Day" is related to when there are many versions of a Single/Album.

Hello! I am happy that this website is still going. I keep it bookmarked and try to check in every once in a while, it could be a few years but I do check in! Lol! 

Yes, I noticed that you had a system failure. Thats VERY unfortuneate. We did have some good conversations on here about Lena. I took a look at all the orphaned comments and all of the ones attributed to me are mine. Thank you for trying to atleast make sure they were reposted!

Hello Lena! Its been a while since I have written to you. You have been gone 24 years now. The world is worse for your loss. The world is sadly lacking in beautitul sweet kind souls like you. From one tormented soul to another, I sincerely hope you found in death the peace that you never did in life. Love, from a kindred spirit.

Thanks for the link I was sure the flyer I used was for 1982 but now wondering if it's for 1981 which I have the opening night as 2 August 1981 which would mean the date would need changing for that year's show but I'm not sure as Lena's hair style is more 1982 than 1981. It's a shame flyers tend to not have the year on them.

It's a shame the fly/programme cover used by ninebattles.com is not in full as it may have given the names of some of the other performers on the bill that night which would have help.

**StephenMolloy1** (2023-08-18T19:51:43Z)

The Friday 20th August 1982 edition of The Fulham Chronicle mentions her summer season, which I suppose clarifies the year, but not sadly the date.

The Sky television programme Jameson Tonight was produced in the studio. The show was very cheaply made and basically was trying to be like Johnny Carson in the US without the great host or indeed guests. The most notable I remembered as a guest was the wonderful and gifted Lena Zavaroni plus a great actor who will always been known as the TV favourite ‘Jason King’ aka Peter Wyngarde.

Thanks for the link, sadly very little details are available for "Jameson Tonight", I checked the listings page for the programme via [The Times Digital Archive](https://galeapps.gale.com/apps/auth?userGroupName=bro_ttda&origURL=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.gale.com%2Fps%2FdispBasicSearch.do%3FuserGroupName%3Dbro_ttda%26prodId%3DTTDA&prodId=TTDA) but the "Times" never listed the guests on the programme so no joy there as to which of the dates was Lena's apperance on the programme and the [BFI](https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/5ebb4117a5d0b) page for "Jameson Tonight" is pointless as it has no details on the programme. There are a couple of full episodes on YouTube and a number of clips but none related to Lena. The IMDb only has the [1990](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1830037/) addition of the programme.

I've bitten the bullet and translated it using Google translate, there is the odd questionable result but it is generally good.

Lena can forget about her dolls.

Only ten years young, very cute to see and a voice that roars like a hurricane. That's Lena Zavaroni the new singing prodigy. The record business has already thrown itself at her with full force, because gold can be earned with such a natural talent.
Father and Mother Zavaroni really thought about it for a long time. And only when it was assured that their little girl would not be plunged headlong into the music business, did they give their consent. But from that day on, it was a normal childhood for Lena. She was soon the world's sweetest child prodigy.
A record was quickly made in the record studio, "Ma, He's making eyes at me" and 300,000 copies flew out of stores within a few days. The British record boys rubbed their hands in delight.

By the way, Daddy and Mommy Zavaroni weren't dissatisfied either, because through the booming voice of their ten-year-old offspring the money started pouring in. Lena flew in and out of the studio, made one television program after the other and was allowed to make sweet trips to European countries in between. After all, this great talent should not only be saved for England, no, the mainland also had to kneel before the endearing prodigy. And so it is that from now on you will regularly see and hear dear little Lena on the tube. And now you should start shouting impatiently for hall performances, because our labor inspectorate is not so generous with that for prodigies. Just think of Hein and Wilma.
In England this is seen somewhat more broadly. The little girl can also be seen on television all the time. But because you can't immediately tear such a cutie out of the familiar world of her dolls and skipping rope, the English labor inspectorate has determined that Lena is not allowed to perform more than forty times a year. Furthermore, the little darling is also not allowed to hang out in the studios after ten o'clock at night.
And that's where the aftercare stops, because of course you can't keep going. After all, Lena also has her sweet caring parents.
	"A special talent"
"The big problem for Mr. and Mrs. Zavaroni was how to publicize their little miracle without harming her upbringing in any way. Rightly so, for they were extremely concerned about the development of Lena's career, " wrote Phonogram in a biography of the Scottish prodigy. However, Lena's parents got in touch with Philip Solomon, a manager who is trained to keep very young talents on the right track, Solomon said. "At first I didn't feel like starting something with such a young girl, but when I heard Lena sing, I realized I was dealing with a very special talent. I will guide her further."

She is indeed special, because the simple Lena, who says very sweet things about the Netherlands during a conversation, that she likes being here and things like that, the same Lena becomes a creepy personality as soon as she is behind the microphone.
There is no longer a girl who would much rather play with her dolls and romp in the street with her girlfriends, but a real star! A creature that blindly imitates what the grown-ups have pumped into her. Professional movements, mischievous steps behind the microphone, a lot of working with the arms and the occasional almost comical, but certainly not intended, mischievous look into the camera.
	Expensive house in London
The future looks healthy for Lena - financially at least - yes. But the commercials and record guys won't spare her, because she just happens to be ten. Multitudes of records will have to be filled from them and she will be dragged from one unit corner of Europe to another, living within the shackles of success.
On the other hand, there is a rapidly growing bank account belonging to papa Zavaroni, a man who used to have to be frugal as a sales representative. Lena never had to nag for a new doll for a long time, such a little extra is also welcome because Lena's golden voice made it possible for father and mother to buy a very expensive house in London. London has become their new base: that's where the studios are and that's where the big world begins for Lena.
Meanwhile, Lena's spiritual formation is not neglected either. Papa has sent her to the Italia Conti School, a famous London institution for rich kids, where she is taught the necessary knowledge through private tuition. After all, the ten-year-old prodigy cannot remain stupid...

Photograph caption.
Playing with balloons, blowing fun bubbles or just doing what she likes is no longer an option for little Lena. The balloons and soap bubbles can only be used in front of the photographer's camera. For the rest, Lena can forget that, prodigy as she is.

**StephenMolloy1** (2023-06-21T12:27:06Z)

Thanks, I hadn't caught the Newsbank post.  The "Walking past a chippie"  quote is a new one. The trouble with liars is that they struggle to remember which version of their truth they told last week. I suspect that Hughie Green tipped off Philip Solomon about a brilliant little singer auditioning in Glasgow, he then sent Tommy Scott to go find out about her.

**FanzOfLenaZavaroni** (2023-06-21T14:49:29Z)

I'm not sure why so many versions of how Lena was discover has came about. Makes me wonder why there is a need to lie about such a thing. Is it just so important too each of the individuals to be know as the person that discover Lena or is there a another reason for the misleading stories. So quick to want to be known as the discoverer of Lena not so quick to admit their exploitation of her.

So now the story is that Tommy Scott was walking pass the Zavaroni family chip shop when from the flat above he heard someone singing and so went into the chippy to find out who it was and that lead to him bring Phil Solomon to Rothesay where he heard Lena sing in the Rothesay Pavilion.

Hold on what happen to the Athletic Bar where Tommy Scott heard Lena singing. Oh scrap the above he was walking pass an unnamed chip shop when he heard Lena singing in the Athletic Bar which was in Gallowgate and nowhere near a chip shop. Oh scrap that as well I was walking pass a chippy and carried on until I turn a corner into Gallowgate where I came upon the Athletic Bar where I heard a singer. Yes! Yes, this version will do (I did not known fiction was so hard).

I think the truth is that Green, Solomon and Scott already had a plan in place for Lena that for reasons (money being one of them) they did not what the public at large to know about and so did not want to connect Green with the other two.

A large system failure has meant I had to do a full reinstall of this website. Sadly it has meant the lost of all visitor comments on this website, I still have all the comments as emails but that doesn't mean I will be able to add them back here.

I will look to see if I can run the comment system in a separate repository so that any system failure of the website's repo. will not effect the comments and see if there is a way to back up the comments. That doesn't mean the comments repo. could not have a failure of its own but keeping them separate seem the best way to go if it can be done.

This will take time if it can be done, as my coding skills are limited plus my on going heath issues with my hands has already limited how much time I can spend updating the website without this additional work behind the scenes.

**FanzOfLenaZavaroni** (2023-03-20T18:10:37Z)

I have defined the recreated comments as Orphaned Comments and they should be available to view on the original page (maybe via a link) they were made on and are grouped under the Category: [Orphaned Comments](https://fanzoflenazavaroni.github.io/categories/#Orphaned-Comments).

As I can't recreated my comments as GitHub does not email me my own comments, not all comments have been recreated I know this is a shame but those I have not recreated make little sense without the context of my comments.

**FanzOfLenaZavaroni** (2023-03-15T13:33:04Z)

I have change the way biographies are saved on this website they are now located in a sub-folder of the "post" section with their date-of-birth used as the post date this makes them easier to manage with the "Liquid Template Language" and will now automatically show up on the "Posts" page and will also automatically show up on any related "On This Days" E.G, on their birthday and where applicable on their death day.

It also means they now have a section using their name in the "Categories" section so visitors can view all content related to an individual by going to their name within the "Categories" section.

I updated the page with the photo you shared with me and added a link to the website for SHARE it has a number of clips from various shows but sadly none of Lena.

It's difficult to pin down a correct date for these photographs, I'm not brilliant with foreign language newspapers, but this 8th April paper is the earliest record that I can find of her in Holland.

Thanks for the link.

Who knows‽ first date I had was from The Press Association that gives a date of 25 April 1974.
Then I got the 30 March 1974 via  the [Nationaal Archief](https://www.nationaalarchief.nl/onderzoeken/zoeken?activeTab=photos&rm=list&searchTerm=lena%20zavaroni).
While the link you sent can confirm Lena was in Holland on the 8th April 1974 the article does not mention when Lena first went there or when she left so the date of the photos from Madurodam Miniature City is still open to question for now I feel I have to leave the post on this date as it's the one currently provide by Nationaal Archief and as it the county's national archives I would hope they got the date right but as we both know that may not be the case, so I close this comment as I opened it Who knows‽

I got it translated by taking a screenshot of related text and then used [imagetotext](https://www.imagetotext.info) to get the text then copied and pasted that into Google Translate at some stage I will try and sort out the errors that are always made during Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

**StephenMolloy1** (2023-03-31T14:31:20Z)

Found three Dutch newspapers for 1st April with photographs of Lena at Madurodam so 30th March is probably the correct date.

Thanks for the links.

I added a section to the post about the [Dates](https://fanzoflenazavaroni.github.io/1974-03-30-madurodam-miniature-city/#dates) and a new post as an example to show how there may be more to a [typo](https://fanzoflenazavaroni.github.io/2012-05-30-the-daily-record/) than it may at first seem and why we should never take anything at face value.

**StephenMolloy1** (2023-04-01T13:17:44Z)

I notice that Dorothy Solomon mentioned in one of the articles that Lena wasn't allowed in a television studio after 5:00pm. This must mean that she recorded her Top Of The Pops appearance in the afternoon.

**FanzOfLenaZavaroni** (2023-04-01T15:30:40Z)

Thanks for pointing that out to me, that reinforces Lena's first appearance on TOTP which is available on YouTube as the actual broadcast and not as I thought it was possibly a camera rehearsal. I must amend my post for Lena's first appearance on TOTP.

I remember that you saying that you hadn't read "Personality". Andrew O'Hagen's article in Granta magazine is on the internet archive, it includes a chapter from the book.

It seems that the Soundcloud uploads of the top 20 for this period are using the wrong Radio 1 Logo. The one used in 1973 - 75 was:

Thanks for the link to the correct image related to the dates we are interested in.

I'm not surprised that the thumbnails used are wrong some of the files use an image of the artist who was at number 1 that week but may not be of how the artist looked in that broadcast year. The individuals uploading just needs a thumbnail to be added to their file and most likely went with an image near the top of any image search they may had done for the Radio 1 logo.

I'm more concerned that this episode of the Top 20 was taken down and hope there are not more removals coming as The Wayback Machine doesn't seem to archive Mixcloud content.

I had downloaded the handful of episodes I had found on there and will check to see if there are others I need to get before any possible take down from Mixcloud it's a bit of a disappointing website in someways for a podcasting platform as it has no RSS feed to just add it to a podcasting app for downloading.

So I had to manually download the few I got manual, well semi-manually as I had to copy and pasted the URLs for each episode into a text file and then run a script to read and then download the audio for each URL.

What I really need to do is find the time to listen to the episodes and make a note of the artist(s), song and chart position so that I can then add that info. to each of the related pages on this website.

While writing this way to long reply I just realised I could just use the details from the "Record and Radio Mirror", I'll need to check but I think they use the same chart data. If they do use the same data then I'll also be able to create pages for broadcasts of Solid Gold Sixty with Tom Browne even if I can't locate audio files of them.

**StephenMolloy1** (2023-03-04T01:58:53Z)

I've put it on my You Tube Channel to try get away from the reliance on Mixcloud. Like you, I will try to get all of Lena's appearances put up on You Tube, but as you said - it isn't straightforward. 

<h2 id="infobox2"><a href="#infobox2">1975-12-29-opportunity-knocks/</a></h2>

Lena appears as last year’s winner, to present the award to the 1975 recipient, The Frank Jennings Syndicate.

In this book, she also appeared a week earlier in a special songwriters show, there was an edition of Opportunity Knocks on the 22nd according to The Television & Radio Database, but I haven't been able to find out anything else as yet.

Hi Stephen, pleased to see the committing is working as you may be aware I have had issues with it. Anyway, I'll get on to the subject.

I am aware of this episode of Opportunity Knocks it was a special in which musical compositions competed to win the Opportunity Knocks' Golden Note Award and £500 towards furthering their musical career.

It had a set of judges and was more like a precursor to New Faces than the usual Opportunity Knocks we know.

Info for the episode is on the [British Film Institute (BFI)](http://collections-search.bfi.org.uk/web/Details/ChoiceFilmWorks/150512572) page for the episode along with a link to the cast of the episode.

<hr>

I think you will find that the Kaleidoscope book has given the date (22 December 1975) and title for "Opportunity Knocks Songwriters Show 1975" but somehow has given the cast for the following show of the 29th in which both Lena Zavaroni and Tammy Jones were on.

Makes me wonder if in rereleased versions of the book, this error would have been acknowledged and fixed as well as other errors the book may have had as many books of this type have errors that get fixed on later releases.


**StephenMolloy1** (2023-01-22T15:31:58Z)

Thanks for clearing this up, I forgot to consider that they might have printed inaccurate information.
