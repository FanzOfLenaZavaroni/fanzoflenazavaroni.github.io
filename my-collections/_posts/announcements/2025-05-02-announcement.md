I (Robcamstone) believe that media cannot be considered fair use if it features a watermark that was not authorized by the original copyright holder.

As a result, **Fanz of Lena Zavaroni no longer includes images or videos in its posts**, and a significant number of previously shared images have been removed. This decision stems from the widespread practice of individuals taking copyrighted media, adding their own watermarks, and implying ownership, which I do not support.

Unfortunately, this has impacted the creation of new content—some posts simply **lose their effectiveness without supporting images**. While I remain committed to keeping the site active, if content theft continues to negatively affect it, I may have to place the website in **archive status**. This means no new posts would be added, and only minor cosmetic updates would occur as needed.

For example, recent updates to the **OnThisDay** pages introduced navigation improvements, such as **« Previous Day** and **Next Day »** links, as well as a centred link for **[Visit Leap Year February 29]** on February 28.

To all **genuine fans**, I deeply appreciate your support. I do not want to stop updating this website, but without images to properly frame the content, my options remain limited.
