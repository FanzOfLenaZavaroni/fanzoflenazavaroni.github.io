<p>Images were removed due to repeated content theft, supported by fan sites that disregard ethical boundaries.</p>
<p>Many who claim to be fans reduce Lena Zavaroni to a product, ignoring the real person behind the public image and all that she endured.</p>

</ul>
<p>Some fans submitted false claims to Facebook aimed at shutting down the Facebook page and this website because I would not toe the line and only support the fantasy Lena. Instead, I gave a space where truth could be spoken about Lena. I also rejected their unauthorised use of images and videos and spoke out against their use of watermarks. While Facebook put an unfair block on this website being shared on Facebook the closing of the Facebook Group was my call because why would I use a platform that put blocks on without checking the facts and even now that the blocks have been removed I will not return to using Facebook and as you can see the website is still up and running so in real terms the lying fans got nowhere.</p>
<p>True fans know better, and we can only hope in the long term the fake fans lose their negative hold on the fandom.</p>
