<p>Fanz of Lena Zavaroni has always been built on respect — respect for Lena, respect for copyright, and respect for the truth. Over the years I’ve added hundreds of posts, researched countless sources, and tried to build the most accurate media‑based record of Lena’s life that I can.</p>

<p>Recently, however, the work has changed in ways I never planned for.
<p>The removal of images — due to widespread copyright misuse and unauthorised watermarking by others — has made many posts difficult or impossible to present properly. Some entries now consist only of a date and Lena’s name, because the original context came from an image I can no longer use. While these dates still matter, creating long stretches of minimal posts is not sustainable or enjoyable.</p>

<p>There is also a practical limit to how much can be researched. Many newspaper scans have poor OCR, some articles are inaccessible, and not every detail of Lena’s life survives in a usable form. I’ve always known the archive could never be “complete,” but accepting that emotionally is harder than accepting it logically.</p>

<p>For these reasons, <strong>the site will now move into archive status.</strong></p>
<p>This means:</p>

<ul>
<li>The website will remain online.</li>
<li>All existing posts will stay available.</li>
<li>I will continue to make small fixes when needed.</li>
<li>But no new posts will be added on a regular basis.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not me turning my back on Lena.</p>
<p>It’s simply me recognising the limits of what one person can do while still keeping the archive honest, respectful, and true to its purpose.</p>

<p>To everyone who has visited, researched, or supported the site — thank you.</p>
<p>The archive remains here for you, and for Lena’s legacy.</p>
