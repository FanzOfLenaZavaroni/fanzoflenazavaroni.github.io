### Am - FM
> At the time of broadcast Radio 1 was only available on Medium Wave so when the BBC broadcasted some of its music programmes it also broadcasted them on Radio 2 VHF so that listeners with a VHF Radio could enjoy a higher quality of sound than was available on Medium Wave.
>
> Medium Wave makes use of amplitude modulation where as VHF makes use of frequency modulation.
