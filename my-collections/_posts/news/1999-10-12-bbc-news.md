<p>The funeral of former child star Lena Zavaroni will take place on Friday 15 October, her family have said.</p>
<p>The service will be held at St Augustus Roman Catholic Church in Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, where she lived for several years and where her father and younger sister still live.</p>
<p>The 35-year-old singer died on 1 October following brain surgery to combat the eating disorder anorexia, which she had suffered from for 22 years.</p>

<p>Her cousin Margaret said hundreds of mourners were expected at the funeral, including family, friends and showbusiness colleagues.</p>
<p>"We would like to say thank you to everybody who has sent us their sympathy and flowers," she said at her home on the Isle of Bute off west Scotland.</p>
<p>"Lena's father has asked for flowers to be sent to anorexia sufferers."</p>
<p>Family members expected to attend the funeral include her father Victor, his wife Christine, his two brothers and Lena's younger sister Carla.</p>
<p>But her former husband Peter Wiltshire, who has recently remarried, said he would not be attending the funeral.</p>
<p>Lena Zavaroni was born on the Isle of Bute and shot to fame at just nine years old after singing on Opportunity Knocks.</p>

<p>She was the winner on the talent show for five weeks in a row and went on to top the charts with Ma, He's Making Eyes At Me.</p>
<p>At the age of 12 she sang for the Queen at a Royal Variety performance and appeared alongside Frank Sinatra and Liza Minnelli at a charity concert in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>But it was at the height of her fame, aged 13, that she developed the eating disorder anorexia.</p>
<p>Her career slipped and she retired from showbusiness when she married businessman Peter Wiltshire in 1989.</p>
<p>The marriage broke up after 18 months and she moved to Hoddesdon, to be near her father and his wife.</p>
<p>By her mid thirties, Lena was living in a council flat in Hertfordshire and surviving on Â£48.80 weekly state benefits.</p>
<p>She fought a constant battle with anorexia and depression, and was admitted to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff earlier this year in a final attempt to overcome her illness.</p>
<p>On 7 September, she underwent a rare operation to remove the part of her brain that was believed to be controlling her anorexia, but contracted pneumonia after the surgery.</p>
<p>An inquest into her death has been opened and adjourned.</p>
