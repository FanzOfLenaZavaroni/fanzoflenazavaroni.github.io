<p>An anorexia sufferer, who has taken the name of a singing star who died of the disease, is fighting for better respite care.</p>
<ul>
<li>The caption below the photo of Lena Zavaroni states: Lena Zavaroni died of pneumonia in 1999 aged <s>33</s> ( <a href="#infobox4">incorrect she was 35</a> ).</li>
<li>Ellie Zavaroni, who took the name of her friend Lena Zavaroni after the singer died in 1999, is battling againt the debilitating disease.</li>
<li>She has not eaten normally since February 2002 and has lost a leg because of the disease.</li>
<li>Lena Zavaroni, a child star who rose to fame in 1973 on the show Opportunity Knocks, died of <s>anorexia</s> at the age of <s>33</s> ( <a href="#infobox5">incorrect she never die of anorexia</a> and <a href="#infobox4">she was not 33 when she died</a> ).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="infobox2" class="infobox"><a href="#infobox2">Too ill</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Ellie Zavaroni, who lives in Skegness, knew her for 15 years.</li>
<li>"I went through what Lena went through with the illness.</li>
<li>"She always said: 'You are stronger than me.'</li>
<li>"She told me to use my voice and use it for the people out there."</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="infobox3" class="infobox"><a href="#infobox3">Ellie Zavaroni wants special respite care</a></h3>
<p>Ms Zavaroni, who is now is only kept alive by a feeding tube, wants respite care at a specialist anorexia centre, but none is available in Lincolnshire.</p>
<p>She is too ill to take up a place offered to her in Sheffield.</p>
<p>"I need help and I need it now. I feel that tomorrow will be too late," she said.</p>
<p>"And I can tell you that a general medical ward cannot handle the problems of anorexia."</p>
<p>The United Lincolnshire Hospital NHS trust has said in a statement: "Our complex care manager is working together with Ellie Zavaroni and all involved in her care to develop an appropriate package of care for her."</p>
<p>Ellie says she will continue to fight for better care for people with anorexia.</p>

<li id="infobox4">Lena Zavaroni was 35 years 10 months 27 days old when she died.</li>
<li id="infobox5">Lena Zavaroni died of Bronchopneumonia which she contracted while in hospital having undergone Neurosurgery for Mental Disorder (NMD) as a last resort to manager her depression.</li>
<li id="infobox6">Ellie was offered a placement in Sheffield <a class="external-link" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Lincolnshire+to+Sheffield+approx+travel+time+by+car+in+2022%3F">approximately 2 hours by car</a>, and I would have thought she would be taken by ambulance if she needed one. It’s notable that Ellie was able to speak to the media, yet felt unable to take up the placement in Sheffield. That contrast raises questions about what kind of support she truly needed—and whether more could have been done to help her accept the care offered.</li>
