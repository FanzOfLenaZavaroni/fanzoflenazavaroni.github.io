### Comments
> * Lena Zavaroni was 35 years 10 months 27 days old when she died.
> * Lena Zavaroni died of Bronchopneumonia which she contracted while in hospital having undergone Neurosurgery for Mental Disorder (NMD) as a last resort to manager her depression.
> * Ellie was offered a placement in Sheffield approximately 2 hours by car and I would have thought she would be taken by ambulance if she needed one. (so too ill to take up a place offered to her in Sheffield, but not too ill to talk to the media).
