### Comments
> If you find the BBCs archive version of the article hard to read as it's an archive page and as such was created for much smaller screen sizes follow this [link](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s225/sh/ba4ef6db-6735-4b36-9000-3b845f1f1479/15994d8fea61189c5d4c884f31ff81d4) to my Evernote copy that is easer to read.

> ### Note
> * Lena Zavaroni was 35 years 10 months 27 days old when she died.
> * Lena Zavaroni died of Bronchopneumonia which she contracted while in hospital having undergone Neurosurgery for Mental Disorder (NMD) as a last resort to manager her depression.
> * Ellie was offered a placement in Sheffield approximately 2 hours by car and I would have thought she would be taken by ambulance if she needed one. (so too ill to take up a place offered to her in Sheffield, but not too ill to talk to the media).
