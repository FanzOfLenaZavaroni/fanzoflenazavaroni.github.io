<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Press Association gives a date of 25 April 1974</p>
<p>I suspect that the date of 25 April 1974 is the date the photos were released to various news agencies around the world including the UK's Press Association and that the date of the 30 March 1974 was the actual date Lena Zavaroni visited The Madurodam Miniature City, South-Holland, The Hague.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nationaalarchief.nl/onderzoeken/zoeken?activeTab=photos&rm=list&searchTerm=lena%20zavaroni">Nationaal Archief</a> is the national archives of the Netherlands, located in The Hague. The date of the 30 March 1974 is the date given on their website. </p>

<p>Alamy and Getty Images seem to be going by the date use by The Press Association.</p>

<p>The question as to why The Press Association has the date of 25 April 1974 it could be an error but I think it's more likely that the photos were kept for use in Holland and only approximately a month after, they were given clearance for use around the world on the 25 April 1974 but if that was the reason for the date then the Originators of the photos and related details and or The Press Association really should make it clear that the actual date Lena was visiting the Madurodam Miniature City was the 30 March 1974 and the date of 25 April 1974 was just a world wide release date for the photos as leaving out such details leads to errors in information, for example Alamy and Getty Images giving the wrong date for when Lena was visiting Madurodam Miniature City.</p>

<p>This is why all visitors should take all details with a pinch of salt.</p>

<p>I hope visitors will read the comments below where links to the Dutch newspapers provide By StephenMolloy1 of Loving Lena Zavaroni add to the evendance that the 30 March 1974 is the correct date for when Lena visited the Madurodam Miniature City.</p>
