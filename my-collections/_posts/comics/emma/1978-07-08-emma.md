<p>Summary based on the original article published on 8 July 1978.</p>
<p>Lena shares her excitement about her first trip to America, where one of the highlights was visiting Disneyland. A lifelong Disney fan, she was thrilled to explore the park’s themed lands including Adventureland, Bear Country, Frontierland, Fantasyland, and Tomorrowland. She especially enjoyed the thrilling ride <em>Space Mountain</em> and the immersive <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> boat journey. Lena also rode the <em>Mark Twain</em> riverboat, the Disneyland mini-train, and got spooked in the haunted house. She saw beloved characters like Snow White and Dumbo, and her favourite treat was a banana covered in chocolate ice cream and nuts. Lena ends by saying she agrees with Disneyland’s nickname: “the happiest place in the world.”</p>
