<p>Summary based on the original article published on 8 July 1978.</p>
<p>emma shares her excitement about her first trip to America, where one of the highlights was visiting Disneyland. A lifelong Disney fan, she was thrilled to explore the park’s themed lands like Adventureland, Fantasyland, and Tomorrowland. She especially enjoyed rides like Space Mountain and Pirates of the Caribbean, and loved meeting Disney characters. Other memorable experiences included the haunted house, the Mark Twain riverboat, and classic attractions like Dumbo and Snow White. Her favourite treat was a banana covered in chocolate ice cream and nuts. emma calls Disneyland “the happiest place in the world”—a sentiment she wholeheartedly agrees with.</p>
