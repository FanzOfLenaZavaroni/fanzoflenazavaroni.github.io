<p>Currently working on a Summary of the article  to replace the images due to content theft which would not be an issue if it was not for the fact that way to many people support such fan behaviour.</p>
<p>Comments "On Where I stand" should not be left on this post as once this temporary card gets replaced with the required card your comments would become orphaned, so I would advised visitors that wish to comment on "where I stand" to go to the following Notice: <a href="/2025-07-28-announcement/#infobox1">Media Integrity Over Fandom Misuse</a>.</p>
