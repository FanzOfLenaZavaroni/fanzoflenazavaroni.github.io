<tr><th style="vertical-align:top;">Robcamstone:</th><td>I beleave the Carnival Princess was around 15 years old so a completely inappropriate comment considering her age, whether or not she heard it.
<br /><br />
I have no doubt Bernie Winters just thought he was being funny and had not consider the implications of his comment.</td></tr>
