Lena's then new sing was released on 3 April 1981 for more detail visit my discography section for the single <a href="/discography/singles/1981-04-03-roses-and-rainbows">Roses And Rainbows</a>

<h3 id="infobox2"><a href="#infobox2">Woolco Department Store Opened 1972</a></h3>
<blockquote>In the late 1960’s and early 1970’s the then Hatfield Rural District Council and the Commission for the New Towns were concerned about the inadequacy of the shopping facilities within Hatfield Town Centre. The solution was to adopt a new system of trading introduced by the Woolco Division of F.W.Woolworth Ltd. The new store was described as “An out of town department store in the Town Centre”.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>I am sure this personal appearance by Lena Zavaroni at the store not only helped with the promotion of her single but also brought the Woolco store to the attention of the wider public. The event benefited both Lena and the store.</p>
<p>The photo of Lena signing the plaster cast of eight-year-old Donna Jerome must also have contributed to that promotion.</p>
