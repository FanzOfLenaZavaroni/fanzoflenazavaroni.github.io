<blockquote>
<p>A SEAFRONT flat is on the market for as little as £10,000 - but buyers are warned it is a potential death-trap.</p>
<p>The one-bed property has spectacular sea views but is so badly run-down no mortgage firm will lend against it.</p>
<p>The flat in Rothesay, on the Isle of Bute, is also considered too dangerous to view before it is auctioned with a guide price of £10,000 on May 18.</p>
<p>It also comes with a showbiz link - it is above a chippy once run by 1970s child star Lena Zavaroni's family.</p>
<p>But a spokesman for Auction House Scotland admitted: "The property may not appeal to everyone."</p>
