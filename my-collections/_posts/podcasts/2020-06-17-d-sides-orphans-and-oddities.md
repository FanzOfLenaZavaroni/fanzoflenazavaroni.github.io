<p><span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;">EMBED NO MORE:</span> The former podcast <strong>D-Sides, Orphans, and Oddities</strong> has transitioned to an audio stream. Episodes are now removed after two weeks, eliminating the archive and tracklisting features. As a result, specific episodes—including those featuring Lena Zavaroni—can no longer be identified. Past podcast details remain on the related pages, but with embedded content removed, as the original embed feature is no longer functional. Since the stream does not offer archives, new episodes will not be added to this website.</p>

<p>Dino, Desi & Billy - Lady Love (1970) The group was never a favorite of the critics. Writing for Allmusic.com, music critic Richie Unterberger characterized them as a group that "never had an ounce of credibility", with music that was "innocuously bland in the extreme." These sentiments may be contrasted with the fact that the band was well thought of by the Beach Boys, to the extent that Brian Wilson and [Billy]Hinsche co-wrote one of the band's original songs, and their final single, "Lady Love". That single was released by Reprise Records in 1970, after the group had broken up. Hinsche's sister, Annie, married Carl Wilson and Hinsche himself worked with the Beach Boys as a backing musician for many years.</p>
