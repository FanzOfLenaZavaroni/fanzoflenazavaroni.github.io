<p>There aren’t many actors across stage and screen who have had a career like Bonnie Langford. Across five decades, she has cemented herself as a certified national treasure - even if she’s far too humble to admit such a thing!</p>
<p>She sits down with Kate to discuss the highlights from her storied career, the renewed need to relieve the pressure and enjoy her work and how sometimes you’ve just got to get a little bit angry. Enjoy!</p>
