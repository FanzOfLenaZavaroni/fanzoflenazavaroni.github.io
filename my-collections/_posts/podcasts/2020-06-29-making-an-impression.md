<p>When O'Sullivan was a child, her first television appearance was in Seaside Special (1976). This was followed by appearances in Crackerjack, where she was awarded the title "Crackerjack Young Entertainer of the Year 1978" for her impressions of Frank Spencer, The Muppet Show, Margaret Thatcher, and <strong>Lena Zavaroni</strong> in Crackerjack. On winning the competition, for which 900 other hopefuls had auditioned, she was given an Aiwa stereo system, a signed photograph of Bernie Clifton, and a coveted Crackerjack pen.</p>
