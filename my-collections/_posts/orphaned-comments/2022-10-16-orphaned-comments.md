<p>Due to a system failure logged <a class="link" href="https://github.com/FanzOfLenaZavaroni/fanzoflenazavaroni.github.io/discussions/2">here</a> The comments made by visitors were lost.</p>
<p>So the following comments are recreated from the original emails generated by Github when the comments were made.</p>
<p>Sadly Github did not send me emails of my comments or replies, so that is why some of the comments will feel strange as the commenter may be responding to one of my missing comments.</p>
<p>That is why I have defined them as Orphaned Comments.</p>

<p>Comment:</p>
<p>The world misses you Lena, our brightest star. Its now been 21 years since your death. The worst part about this is, the
people that did the things that were done you in your life and death have never been brought to justice. Knowing what I
now know, I can't help but wonder if you were a victim of the hollywood elites.</p>
<p>I promise to you Lena, your memory, your life and your music will live on as long as I draw breath. Fly away dear angel.
Be at peace.</p>
<p>~Chris</p>
