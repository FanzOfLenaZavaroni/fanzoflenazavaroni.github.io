<p>Due to a system failure logged <a class="link" href="https://github.com/FanzOfLenaZavaroni/fanzoflenazavaroni.github.io/discussions/2">here</a> The comments made by visitors were lost.</p>
<p>So the following comments are recreated from the original emails generated by Github when the comments were made.</p>
<p>Sadly Github did not send me emails of my comments or replies, so that is why some of the comments will feel strange as the commenter may be responding to one of my missing comments.</p>
<p>That is why I have defined them as Orphaned Comments.</p>

<p>While I can't remember what I commented. I do remember I went looking for details and ended up ordering a copy of her death certificate.</p>

<p>Comment:</p>
<p>A few weeks would have gone by while I waited for a copy of the death certificate which would have then added as a image in a comment.</p>
