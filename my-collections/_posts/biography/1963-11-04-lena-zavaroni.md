<div class="CardItem split">
<p>There are multiple conflicting accounts of how Lena Zavaroni was first discovered. Below is one version told by Phil Solomon, but other sources present significantly different details.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Record producer Tommy Scott happened to be on vacation in Rothesay and heard Lena singing in the Athletic Bar with the Zavaroni Family Band. Tommy’s old buddy Phil Solomon, takes up the story:</p>
<p>I was looking for a girl singer at the time. Tommy rang me up and said he’d found a sensational little girl up in Scotland, so we flew up to Glasgow and took a ferryboat to the Isle of Bute. On the boat, Tommy suddenly turned to me and said, ‘Oh, incidentally, the girl’s only nine!’ I could have killed him. He knew I’d dealt with kids in the past and had vowed never to work with them again because they are too much trouble. Anyway, Tommy kept insisting that this child was different, but I was in a dark mood by the time we got to Rothesay.</p>

<p>We picked this little girl up and went to a deserted dance hall called “The Pavilion” to see her act. Her uncle and father accompanied her, and suddenly I heard this incredible voice singing the theme from “The Godfather.” It took only eight bars, and I knew this was a fantastic talent.</p>

<p>From this moment, under the management of Dorothy Solomon, Phil Solomon’s partner, Lena enjoyed outstanding success.</p>

<h3 id="infobox10" class="infobox"><a href="#infobox10">Conflicting Reports on Lena’s Discovery</a></h3>
<p>There is no single, verified version of how Lena was discovered. Different sources offer varying accounts, often contradicting one another.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a class="external-link" href="https://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/theatre/1780852/Lena-Zavaroni-opportunity-knock-hughie-green">Express (14 June 2023 Updated 15 June 2023)</a>: In an article by Richard Barber it is stated that Tommy Scott was walking past the chippie when he heard Lena singing.</li>
<li>The Lowell Sun (22 July 1974): A US newspaper article described Lena Zavaroni as being discovered while singing in a bingo parlour, highlighting her powerful voice and the immediate interest from the record industry.</li>

<h3 id="infobox11" class="infobox"><a href="#infobox11">UK and US Versions</a></h3>
<p>If we put the UK versions down to editorial errors and that the commonly known version is true, then what about the US version that is clearly different?</p>
<p>Is it that in the UK narratives, Lena’s discovery is grounded in personal connection and happenstance — Tommy Scott on holiday, hearing a young girl sing with her family. It’s intimate, almost folkloric. Whereas the US version, in contrast, skips the mentorship arc and places her in a public, working-class setting like a bingo parlour, with swift exploitation by the industry. It’s cinematic, immediate, and hits themes of American showbiz spectacle.</p>
<p>These aren't just contradictory — they're reflections of two different lenses on celebrity. One leans into charm and luck; the other leans into dazzling talent and economic opportunity.</p>

<h3 id="infobox12" class="infobox"><a href="#infobox12">Summary of Contradictions</a></h3>
<p>The multiple versions of Lena Zavaroni’s discovery raise questions about accuracy, intent, and the motives behind how her story has been told. While Tommy Scott and Phil Solomon are frequently credited, even their accounts vary — from a vacation encounter in the Athletic Bar to a chance meeting outside a chip shop.</p>

<p>With the addition of the US narrative, the contradictions grow more significant. In UK tellings, Lena’s discovery is framed through personal connection and mentorship — Scott hears her sing during a vacation and brings Solomon into the fold. It's all very folkloric. The US version, however, sets the scene in a bingo parlour and skips over any handlers, placing the focus on Lena’s raw talent and immediate commercial appeal.</p>

<p>These differences aren’t merely about misremembered details — they seem to reflect wider cultural differences in how fame is packaged and sold. The UK angle leans into charm and luck; the US angle paints a fast-paced rise through spectacle and industry momentum.</p>

<p>Whether shaped by pride, media embellishment, or more strategic omissions, the full truth of Lena’s discovery may never be entirely clear. But the existence of these varied stories suggests more than confusion — it speaks to the careful shaping of a prodigy’s origin for different audiences.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the media reports are accurate, they imply that Lena Zavaroni’s family only showed retrospective concern—since back in 1974, they allowed their daughter to move in with her agent.</p>
<p>Saying it was Lena’s choice is no justification for allowing it to happen. Parental responsibility involves making difficult decisions, and at that time, Dorothy Solomon was a stranger to them.</p>
<p>Victor Zavaroni only publicly commented on the matter in 2000, long after both Lena and Hilda had passed. The timing of this statement has led to speculation about how the diet was viewed at the time and whether any concerns were raised in 1974.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The comments made by Lena Zavaroni, combined with repeated questioning about her weight in interviews, helped create the myth that TV companies and/or her management team struggled to find clothes that fit her. In reality, the issue was more likely tied to financial decisions rather than her actual size.</p>
<p>Unlike most other stars, Lena was frequently seen wearing the same outfits again and again. Unsurprisingly, when we look back, we see that she eventually developed anorexia—yet the individuals responsible for her physical and emotional mistreatment have <strong>never</strong> been charged or investigated.</p>
<p>Alongside her struggles with anorexia, Lena endured <strong>lifelong depression</strong>, which persisted throughout her career.</p>
<p>She underwent a number of <a href="#infobox26">treatments</a>, none of which proved effective.</p>

<p>A senior official at the London Psychiatric Clinic finally confirms for the first time that Lena had anorexia nervosa.</p>
<blockquote>We now know she had been anorexic since she was 13 in 1982, she was 19, so it had only taken 6 years for the truth to come out. Confirming that the press had been right and that Lena's managers and parents had been the ones hiding the truth. If the reason for doing so had been because Lena had a right to a private life, that would have been fair. Sadly, it's more likely that as one of the main contributors to Lena becoming anorexic, her managers would not want the truth to be known. The TV Interviewers that also put questions on her wight and size have to take some of the blame along with her parents who let such questioning of a child, their child to take place.</blockquote>

<p>Surgeons at the University Hospital of Wales Cardiff have conducted 56 NMD operations in the past decade. It was there that the former child singing star Lena Zavaroni, who suffered from anorexia, underwent such surgery in 1999 for severe depression. Though the operation seemed to have been a success, she died of Pneumonia less than a month later. According to Brian Simpson, consultant neurosurgeon atiff, the operations his team have conducted have led to a "marked improvement" in roughly half of those being treated for severe depression and OCD. "NMD is not a panacea," Simpson agrees. "It is carefully regulated and only offered to patients for whom all other treatments have failed But in the patients for whom it works well, whose suffering has been indescribable, it transforms their lives."</p>

The famous British child star had been struggling with anorexia for 22 years. In September 1999, after years of psychotherapy, anti-depressants and electroshock treatment had failed, she was admitted to the University Hospital of Wales atiff for a lobotomy. In spite of warnings that the discredited operation could destroy her intellect, erase parts of her memory and change her character, Lena and her family persuaded themselves that it was for the best. After all, Britain&#8217;s most skilled &#8216;brain surgeons&#8217; would be presiding. Bob Burrows, a spokesman for the hospital, pointed out to the London Times that the operation was performed using the latest cutting-edge technology:
&#8220;We are one of the UK&#8217;s premier teaching hospitals and at the leading edge of research and medical technology. Miss Zavaroni came toiff because we are one of the few centres in the world that carry out this operation.&#8221;
Lena died of a chest infection two weeks after the operation. She weighed just 49 lbs.

<li> ——: Respiratory failure (when the lungs cannot take in enough oxygen) due to the air sacs filling with fluid.</li>
<li> ——: lung abscesses.</li>
<li> ——: blood poisoning (septicaemia).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Sadly we know her lifestyle was less then healthy and people with anorexia nervosa are more likely to get Pneumonia , but Lena Zavaroni was in a hospital that should have had very good hygiene.</p>
<p>It is stated by the media that Lena die of Pneumonia, but not how the hospital was treating the Pneumonia  and how when Lena was in hospital she came to get Pneumonia  in the first place.</p>
<p>The death of Lena Zavaroni shows that the Neurosurgery for Mental Disorder she underwent should not have been preformed as she was not of significant weight or health for her body's immune response to cope with any possible postoperative complications.</p>
<p>The inquest as far as we can tell did not take that into account.</p>

<p>Prior to her death Lena was admitted to University Hospital of Wales Cardiff for a psychosurgical operation that was described as "pioneering" and "keyhole surgery to partially interrupt the nerve pathways that control emotions".</p>
<p>The operation took place on 7 September 1999. After the operation she contracted Pneumonia and her weight drop to less than five stone (70 lb, 32 kg), just three weeks later she was dead.</p>
<p>On Lena's <a href="/1999-12-15-death-certificate/">death certificate <sup><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></sup></a> it states she died from Bronchopneumonia  on 1 October 1999.</p>
<p>But the reality of her death is not as straightforward as her death certificate implies. The description of her death as one of natural causes is as far from reality as you could get.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reports of Lena Zavaroni&#8217;s death, described as one of natural causes, is littered with failures and nebulous explanations about the treatment she received during the years leading up to her death. Many give mere justifications why the treatments did not work and emphasise the &#8220;huge problems faced in attempting to treat her illness.&#8221;</p>

<ul>
<li> ——: So It is perfectly natural to believe that a patient with severe depression can make an informed choice.</li>
<li> ——: So It is perfectly natural to be thin and extremely under weight.</li>
<li> ——: So It is perfectly natural to not find out the root cause of the depression and treat that, but instead just isolate parts of the brain.</li>
<li> ——: So It is perfectly natural to have sections of your brain isolated from each other that are normally connected together.</li>
<li> ——: So It is perfectly natural to contract Bronchopneumonia within the sterile environment of the hospital.</li>
<li> ——: So It is perfectly natural to blame your dead patient for the poor medical decisions you made as her medical practitioner.</li>
<li> ——: So It is perfectly natural to use an umbrella term (Neurosurgery for Mental Disorder) instead of naming the precise procedure carried out.</li>
</ul>
<p>If as her doctor claimed she had made it clear that she would again try to take her life and he believed she would. Why was she not SECTIONED under the related part of the mental health act of 1983? and that also proves she was not in a state of mine to make an informed choice.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the Neurosurgery for Mental Disorder she under went would not have been able to be carried out if Lena had been SECTIONED.</p>
<p>Died from natural causes, I don't think so.</p>
