There are a number of charities with the leters SOS as part of their name so at this time it's not clear which of the charities was being represented.

I had thought it was the following charity <a href="https://www.sos-childrensvillages.org/who-we-are/history">SOS Children's Villages</a> but a post by <a class="external-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=260272483031889&amp;set=pcb.260281626364308">Loving Lena Zavaroni</a> suggests that it must be another charity.
