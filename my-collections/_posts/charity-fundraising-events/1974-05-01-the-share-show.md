<ul>
<li>If anyone knows the date of this show and or other details please let us know and if possible provide the source of information.</li>
<li><strong>SHARE</strong> is an acronym for <strong>Share Happily and Reap Endlessly</strong> and it is a Hollywood charity that raises money for children with developmental disabilities.</li>
<li>It's important to note that the title The Cher Show was a comment made by Bruce Forsyth for laughs during an interview with Lena Zavaroni in 1979 and that no such show was produced in which Lena was a guest. In fact, he was so busy playing for laughs that he took little notice of Lena's replies and in doing so mislead a number of viewers as to the title of the charity show Lena took part in and if it was even a charity show.</li>
