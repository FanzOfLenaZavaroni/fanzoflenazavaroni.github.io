<p>The Annual SHARE Boomtown Party was so-named for its Western theme, menu (always plenty of chili) and dress code.</p>
<p>An Annual children's charity benefit show that raises money for children with developmental disabilities held in Hollywood, USA by the charity SHARE.</p>
<p><strong>SHARE</strong> is an acronym for <strong>Share Happily and Reap Endlessly</strong> and it is a Hollywood charity.</p>
<p>I had formaly name the show "The Share Show" but based on information on the <a class="external-link" href="https://share4children.org/our-story/#:~:text=Boomtown%20Party%20and%20Show">charity's website</a> and an article in the <a class="external-link" href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-05-22-vw-466-story.html">Los Angeles Times</a> it has become clear that the show was most likely called "The Annual SHARE Boomtown Party" but it may well have also been refered to as The SHARE show, which is how Lena seemed to refered to it in the interview she did with Bruce Forsyth that due to his need to be funny meant everyone was confuse about what Lena was on about in relation to this show.</p>

<ul>
<li>If anyone knows the date of this show and or other details please let us know and if possible provide the source of information.</li>
<li>It's important to note that the title The Cher Show was a comment made by Bruce Forsyth for laughs during an interview with Lena Zavaroni in 1979 and that no such show was produced in which Lena was a guest. In fact, he was so busy playing for laughs that he took little notice of Lena's replies and in doing so mislead a number of viewers as to the title of the charity show Lena took part in and if it was even a charity show.</li>
