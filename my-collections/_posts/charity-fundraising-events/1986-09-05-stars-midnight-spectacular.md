<strong style="Color:#ff0000;">Article Warning:</strong> Sadly needed for a Personal Appearance that at the time would not have needed one, but time and the ignorance of humankind has made a single word within the charity's name taboo.

> Derived via Latin from the Greek spastikos ("drawing in", "tugging" or "shaking uncontrolably"), the word spastic refers to an alteration in muscle tone affected by the medical condition spasticity, which is seen in spastic diplegia and many other forms of cerebral palsy and also in terms such as "spastic colon".
>
> Sadly due to the ignorance of childhood the word became a term of abuse used in many a school playground (Of cause some of the children would have learned the word from adults and how to use it in a negative way before other children could pick it up from them). While the children that use the term in an abusive way had the ignorance of childhood on their side the parents and teachers did not and should have done more to stamp it out by educating the children as to its real meaning and preventing a medical term from becoming such an offensive word that is now taboo.
>
> Due to the degrading use of the word by So called adults as well as children &quot;The Spastics Society&quot; renamed themselves &quot;<a class="external-link" href="https://www.scope.org.uk/history">Scope</a>&quot; in 1994 and two years later in 1996 &quot;The Scottish Council for the Care of Spastics&quot; became &quot;<a class="external-link" href="http://www.capability-scotland.org.uk/">Capability Scotland</a>&quot;. I have not been able to locate if &quot;Stars Organisation For Spastics&quot; renamed themselves or if they are still an active charity.
>
> It's sad that I have had to explain the original meaning of the word because of the high probability that for some only the taboo meaning remains and it's even sadder that people are still capable of taking a harmless word and perverting it.
