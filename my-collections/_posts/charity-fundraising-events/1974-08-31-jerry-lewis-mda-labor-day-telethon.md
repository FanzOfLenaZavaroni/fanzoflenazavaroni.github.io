<p>On day 1 Lena sang "Ma! He's Making Eyes At Me" and "Help Me Make It Through The Night".</p>
<p>The following day (day 2) she returned to the show to chat with Jerry, and performed "Swinging On A Star" and a solo version of "Rock A Bye Your Baby With A Dixie Melody". She then sang a duet of "Rock A Bye" with Jerry before she sang another version of "Ma! He's Making Eyes at Me".</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Based on my research it would seem that Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon took place on the weekend leading up to Labor Day and in 1974 Labor day fell on 2 September which would place the broadcast dates for that years Telethon as 31 August 1974 & 1 September 1974.</p>
<p>Some sources place the broadcast as including the Monday which would make the two dates of broadcast as 1 & 2 September 1974.</P>
<p><a href="https://www.heathpost.com/2020/09/whats-on-tv-this-labor-day-weekend-1974_1.html">heathpost.com</a> indicates that the boardcast was on WDXR Channel 29 so it's unclear if it was also broadcast on the radio as well as on TV as WDXR is the callsign for the radio station that broadcasts to Paducah, Kentucky. but before it became WDXR it was formerly know as TV-29, there is also a TV broadcaster called WKPD-TV so may be a miss naming by heathpost.com</p>
<p>WKPD-TV is also defind as being on Channel 29 and the broadcaster for Paducah, Kentucky so it seems like various websites have various, but simalor callsigns for the one broadcaster so this makes any of their information open to question. This is why I have stuck with the first day of broadcast as the 31 August 1974 as my research for the broadcast suggusts the weekend leading up to Labor day so that would be the Saturday and Sunday but not the Monday as Monday is Labor Day but at the same time it is call Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon which would make us expect that one of the broadcast dates would be for Labor Day.</p>
<p>syndicated television is a big thing in the US so the show would have been broadcast by multiple stations with the broadcaster for Paducah, Kentucky being just one of many.</p>
<p>Confused I know I am hopefully I will be able to find a programme listing in a US newspaper at some stage that will let me confirm the dates.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Callsigns ending with an "R" usually indicates a Radio Broadcaster while callsigns with "PD" in them tend to be Public TV Broadcasters and just to confuse us some may have what looks like a radio callsign but have "-TV" added on the end I would guess they broadcast both TV and Radio but do not know enough about broadcasting in the US to know for sure.</p>
