<p>As usual HAROLD FIELDING leads the field: for the 3,000-seater OPERA HOUSE he has lined up the cream of the country's prime vaude- ville talent in a series of twice-nightly concerts. Last Sun- day's mammoth offering starred CHARLIE WILLIAMS with the NOLAN SISTERS, JOE HENDER- SON, and SONG SPINNERS, while other bill-toppers to be seen here this month include ROD HULL AND EMU, WALTER LANDAUER, the BACHELORS, <a href="/1975-07-20-harold-fieldings-sunday-night-at-the-blackpool-opera-house">LENA ZAVARONI</a>, FRANK CARSON,
the GRUMBLEWEEDS, TAMMY JONES, and NORMAN COLLIER.</p>
