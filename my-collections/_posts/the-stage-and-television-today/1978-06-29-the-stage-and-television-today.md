<p>Summary based on the original article published on 29 June 1978.</p>
<p>This episode featured a return appearance by piano duo Che and Ray, and guest star <strong>Lena Zavaroni</strong>, who impressed in the final number despite a slightly hesitant start. Lennie Bennett and Jerry Stevens delivered a mix of original and conventional comedy, including a playful sketch imagining if "love" were a rude word. Their chemistry shone in a juggling act with Frediani, though the show overall was seen as lacking innovation.</p>
<p>The review suggested that while the duo showed promise, a bolder format might better showcase their talents in future episodes.</p>
