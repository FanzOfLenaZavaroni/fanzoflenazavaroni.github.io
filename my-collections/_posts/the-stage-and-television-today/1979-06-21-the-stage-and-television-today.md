<p>The ratings shown on this page were compiled by AGB (Audience and General Broadcasting), a company responsible for collecting television audience data during the 1970s. AGB worked on behalf of JICTAR (Joint Industry Committee for Television Advertising Research), a consortium of broadcasters and advertisers that oversaw the UK's TV ratings system. In 1981, the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board (BARB) was established to take over audience measurement nationally.</p>
<p>These figures represent a snapshot from one regional panel (Central Scotland), and were published in The Stage and Television Today. Although partial, such data offers useful insight into viewing habits during the time Lena Zavaroni was active on British television.</p>
