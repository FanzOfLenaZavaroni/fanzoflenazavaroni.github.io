      </h2>
      <div class="CardItem split">
        <p>According to <strong>Stage and Television Today</strong>, Lena Zavaroni had just opened her longest stage engagement to date—a nine-week summer season at Bridlington Spa Theatre. Her agent, Dorothy Solomon, used the occasion to highlight the restrictive UK laws governing child performers, noting that Lena was limited to 80 stage workdays per year, not including rehearsals. Lena herself expressed anticipation for her upcoming 16th birthday on 4 November, which would mark the end of those legal constraints.</p>
        <p>Following the Bridlington run, Lena planned to return to Scotland to complete her education, citing differences in academic calendars between England and Scotland. She also shared her interest in expanding into acting, film, or musical theatre. The show featured a strong supporting lineup including Berni Flint, Cannon and Ball, Stu Francis, and the Second Generation dance troupe.</p>

        <p>This article reflects how Lena's career was shaped during her teenage years. While her agent spoke about changing child performance laws, it's worth noting that some may feel these pressures were too much, especially given how Lena’s life later unfolded. This archive aims to record events as they were reported, while also keeping an eye on the bigger picture.</p>
