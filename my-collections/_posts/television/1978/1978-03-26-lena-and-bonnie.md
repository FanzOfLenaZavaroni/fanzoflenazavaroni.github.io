<div class="CardItem split">
<p>The sequence where Lena and Bonnie appear in three different places on the same set was likely achieved by filming multiple takes using a single locked-off camera, with the performers changing position between each take. These were then combined to give the appearance of multiple versions of them on screen at once. This technique was common in 1970s television, and would have allowed for clean compositing without relying on chroma key, which was still fairly limited at the time. While we don’t have production records to confirm the exact method, this seems the most likely explanation based on what can be seen in the footage.</p>

<div class="CardItem split">
<p>Kent House, also known as The London Studios or LWT Tower, was a 24-storey television complex on London’s South Bank. Built in the early 1970s for London Weekend Television (LWT), it became one of the most advanced colour TV studios in Europe at the time. The complex housed a range of iconic programmes, including The Lena and Bonnie Show, and later served as ITV’s main London base.</p>
<p>Although ITV initially planned to return after redevelopment, the studios were permanently closed in 2018. The site was sold and is now undergoing demolition and redevelopment.</p>
