<h2 id="infobox1"><a href="#infobox1">Details</a></h2>

<p>Lena and Bonnie was recorded on the 17 & 18 January 1978 at the Kent House Studios and was broadcast by London Weekend Television (LWT) on the 26 of March 1978.</p>
<p>It was a one-off special starring Lena Zavaroni and Bonnie Langford.</p>
<p>A number of publicity photographs were taken around the time of the show’s recording, possibly during one or both of the studio dates, although the exact dates are unconfirmed.</p>

<h2 id="infobox2"><a href="#infobox2">Part 1 - Recorded On 17 January 1978</a></h2>
<p>Part 1 of the show opens with Lena & Bonnie performing the song Compatibility. Lena then perform a song and dance medley of disco music. Bonnie then performs a medley of show tunes, Lena and Bonnie then reprise the song Compatibility and it then goes to an advert break.</p>

<h2 id="infobox3"><a href="#infobox3">Part 2 - Recorded On 17 January 1978</a></h2>
<p>Part 2 of the show opens with Lena & Bonnie performing a reprise of the song Compatibility. Lena & Bonnie then perform a medley of Shirley Temple and Judy Garland Songs and Shout by Lulu. Lena then performs Speedy Gonzales, after which Bonnie performs the song I Can Do That. The song Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy is then performed by Lena & Bonnie as the <strong>Compatibility Sisters</strong>. It then goes to another advert break.</p>

<h2 id="infobox4"><a href="#infobox4">Compatibility Sisters</a></h2>
<p>The sequence where Lena and Bonnie appear in three different places on the same set was likely achieved by filming multiple takes using a single locked-off camera, with the performers changing position between each take. These were then combined to give the appearance of multiple versions of them on screen at once. This technique was common in 1970s television, and would have allowed for clean compositing without relying on chroma key, which was still fairly limited at the time. While we don’t have production records to confirm the exact method, this seems the most likely explanation based on what can be seen in the footage.</p>

<h2 id="infobox5"><a href="#infobox5">Part 3 - Recorded On 18 January 1978</a></h2>
<p>Part 3 of the show opens with Lena & Bonnie performing a reprise of the song Compatibility. Bonnie then performs the songs New York, New York & Tomorrow, Lena then performs the songs The Air That I Breathe & Should've Listened To Mama. Lena & Bonnie then reprise the song Compatibility which leads into the final song of the show Razzle Dazzle.</p>

<h2 id="infobox7"><a href="#infobox7">Interview With Bonnie Langford</a></h2>
<p>An archive interview with Bonnie appears on the Wombling Free DVD released by Network (catalogue number 7952490). The interview dates from early 1978, as Bonnie mentions she has “just finished” work on the musical special Lena and Bonnie, which was recorded on 17–18 January 1978. Network has since closed, so their edition of the DVD is no longer available from the original publisher. The interview focuses mainly on Wombling Free, with only a brief reference to Lena and Bonnie.</p>

<h2 id="infobox8"><a href="#infobox8">Summary of the “Lena and Bonnie” Mention</a></h2>
<p>In the interview, Bonnie explains that she had recently completed a one‑hour musical special titled Lena and Bonnie with Lena Zavaroni. She describes it as a fully musical programme featuring singing and dancing throughout, and notes that it was scheduled for broadcast on Easter Sunday.</p>

<h2 id="infobox9"><a href="#infobox9">About Kent House Studio (The London Studios)</a></h2>
<p>Kent House, also known as The London Studios or LWT Tower, was a 24-storey television complex on London’s South Bank. Built in the early 1970s for London Weekend Television (LWT), it became one of the most advanced colour TV studios in Europe at the time. The complex housed a range of iconic programmes, including The Lena and Bonnie Show, and later served as ITV’s main London base.</p>
<p>Although ITV initially planned to return after redevelopment, the studios were permanently closed in 2018. The site was sold and is now undergoing demolition and redevelopment.</p>
