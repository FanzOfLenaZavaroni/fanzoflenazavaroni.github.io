<p>Lena Zavaroni appeared as a guest performer on the Japanese television variety show Big Show: As Long As There Is Song (「ビッグショー 歌のある限り」), broadcast by NHK. The headlined act for the episode was Japanese pop star Kenji Sawada (沢田研二), one of the most prominent solo artists of the era. The programme followed a one-man show format, with guest performers occasionally featured alongside the main act.</p>
<p>During the broadcast Lena performed a Japanese-language version of “Ma! (He’s Making Eyes At Me)” along with two other songs. A Japanese-language single had already been released on July 25, 1974, by Philips, following a recording session held on July 10. This places the single’s release before the television appearance. The performance highlights Lena’s versatility as a young international performer engaging with audiences beyond the English-speaking world.</p>
<p>The full set of songs performed by Lena during the broadcast included:</p>

<div class="CardItem split">
<p><strong>NHK</strong> stands for <strong>Nippon Hōsō Kyōkai</strong> (日本放送協会), which translates to <strong>Japan Broadcasting Corporation</strong>. It is Japan’s national public broadcaster, similar in role to the BBC in the United Kingdom. NHK operates multiple television and radio networks and is funded by viewer licence fees. It was established in 1926 and began television broadcasting in 1953.</p>
<p>NHK is known for its high production standards, educational programming, and cultural broadcasts. It also operates NHK World-Japan, an international service that broadcasts news and cultural content in multiple languages.</p>
<p>Lena Zavaroni stated in interviews that she learnt the Japanese lyrics to “Ma! (He’s Making Eyes At Me)” phonetically. While she didn’t specify exactly when she began learning them, the song was recorded on July 10, 1974, for a single released by Philips on July 25. Her ability to deliver the lyrics clearly and confidently by that point reflects her professionalism and adaptability.</p>
<p>The programme in which Lena Zavaroni appeared was broadcast on 25 August 1974 as part of NHK’s <i>Big Show: As Long As There Is Song</i> (「ビッグショー 歌のある限り」), a long-running musical variety series. Each episode typically featured a prominent Japanese artist as the central performer, supported by a live orchestra and guest appearances. In this episode, the headlined act was Kenji Sawada (沢田研二), one of Japan’s most popular solo singers of the time. The show’s format and broadcast history are documented on the <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%93%E3%83%83%E3%82%B0%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%BC_%28%E3%83%86%E3%83%AC%E3%83%93%E7%95%AA%E7%B5%84%29">Japanese Wikipedia page for Big Show</a>.</p>

<p>Confirming the details of Lena Zavaroni’s appearance on Japanese television in 1974 required careful cross-referencing of visual evidence, broadcast records, and Japanese-language sources. The episode aired on 25 August 1974 as part of NHK’s <i>Big Show: As Long As There Is Song</i> (「ビッグショー 歌のある限り」), with Kenji Sawada as the headlined act and Lena appearing as a guest performer.</p>
<p>Video footage confirms that Lena performed three songs during the broadcast: “Ma! (He’s Making Eyes At Me)” (in Japanese), “(You’ve Got) Personality”, and “The End of the World”. A Japanese-language single of “Ma! (He’s Making Eyes At Me)” was recorded on 10 July 1974 and released by Philips on 25 July. This places the single’s release before the television appearance, suggesting that Lena’s broadcast performance may have drawn from the studio recording.</p>
<p>Lena stated in interviews that she learnt the Japanese lyrics phonetically. While she didn’t specify when, the timeline confirms she had mastered them by the recording session in early July. While the video footage confirms Lena's setlist, additional context from the broadcast—such as spoken remarks or introductions—may clarify the connection between the single and the performance. However, this information can't be accessed by non-Japanese speakers without a translation.</p>
<p>This post is shared in the spirit of preserving Lena’s legacy with care and accuracy. She gave so much in her short life, and the least we can do is treat her story with the dignity it deserves.</p>
