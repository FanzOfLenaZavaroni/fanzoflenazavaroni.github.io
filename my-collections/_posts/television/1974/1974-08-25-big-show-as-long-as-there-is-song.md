<div class="CardItem split">
<p><strong>NHK</strong> stands for <strong>Nippon Hōsō Kyōkai</strong> (日本放送協会), which translates to <strong>Japan Broadcasting Corporation</strong>. It is Japan’s national public broadcaster, similar in role to the BBC in the United Kingdom. NHK operates multiple television and radio networks and is funded by viewer licence fees. It was established in 1926 and began television broadcasting in 1953.</p>

<p>NHK is known for its high production standards, educational programming, and cultural broadcasts. It also operates NHK World-Japan, an international service that broadcasts news and cultural content in multiple languages.</p>

<p>Lena Zavaroni stated in interviews that she learnt the Japanese lyrics to “Ma! (He’s Making Eyes At Me)” phonetically. While it is not known whether she learnt them specifically for this broadcast or for a studio recording, her ability to deliver the song clearly and confidently reflects her professionalism and adaptability.</p>

<p>The programme in which Lena Zavaroni appeared was broadcast on 25 August 1974 as part of NHK’s <i>Big Show: As Long As There Is Song</i> (「ビッグショー 歌のある限り」), a long-running musical variety series. Each episode typically featured a prominent Japanese artist as the central performer, supported by a live orchestra and guest appearances. In this episode, the headlined act was Kenji Sawada (沢田研二), one of Japan’s most popular solo singers of the time. The show’s format and broadcast history are documented on the <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%93%E3%83%83%E3%82%B0%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%BC_%28%E3%83%86%E3%83%AC%E3%83%93%E7%95%AA%E7%B5%84%29">Japanese Wikipedia page for Big Show</a>.</p>

<p>Confirming the details of Lena Zavaroni’s appearance on Japanese television in 1974 required careful cross-referencing of visual evidence, broadcast records, and Japanese-language sources. The episode aired on 25 August 1974 as part of NHK’s <i>Big Show: As Long As There Is Song</i> (「ビッグショー 歌のある限り」), with Kenji Sawada as the headlined act and Lena appearing as a guest performer.</p>

<p>Video footage confirms that Lena performed three songs during the broadcast: “Ma! (He’s Making Eyes At Me)” (in Japanese), “(You’ve Got) Personality”, and “The End of the World”. A Japanese-language single of “Ma! (He’s Making Eyes At Me)” was also issued in 1974, but the exact release date is unknown. It is not possible to confirm whether the single was released before or after the broadcast, or whether the two are directly connected.</p>

<p>Lena stated in interviews that she learnt the Japanese lyrics phonetically. However, it is not known whether this was done specifically for the television appearance or for the studio recording. Additional context may exist in the original broadcast, particularly in the on-air conversation between Lena and Kenji Sawada, but no translation of their dialogue is currently available.</p>

<p>This post is shared in the spirit of preserving Lena’s legacy with care and accuracy. She gave so much in her short life, and the least we can do is treat her story with the dignity it deserves.</p>
