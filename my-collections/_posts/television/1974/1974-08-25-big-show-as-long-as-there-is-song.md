It is Japan’s national public broadcaster, similar in role to the BBC in the United Kingdom. NHK operates multiple television and radio networks and is funded by viewer license fees. It was established in 1926 and began television broadcasting in 1953.</p>

<p>NHK is known for its high production standards, educational programming, and cultural broadcasts. It also operates NHK World-Japan, an international service that broadcasts news and cultural content in multiple languages.</p>

<p>Lena Zavaroni stated in interviews that she learned the Japanese lyrics to “Ma! (He’s Making Eyes At Me)” phonetically for this appearance. While the exact method she used is unknown, her ability to deliver the song clearly and confidently reflects her professionalism and adaptability.</p>

<p>The episode in which Lena appeared aired on 25 August 1974 and featured Kenji Sawada as the headlined act.

<div class="CardItem split">
<p>Although this post may appear straightforward, confirming the details of Lena Zavaroni’s appearance on Japanese television in 1974 required considerable research. The video footage of the performance provided a starting point, but it lacked a cited source. From there, a combination of Japanese-language resources, broadcast listings, and image comparisons were used to verify the date, program title, and headlined act.</p>

<p>The breakthrough came via the Japanese Wikipedia page for <strong>Big Show: As Long As There Is Song</strong>, which confirmed the show’s format and helped identify the episode aired on 25 August 1974 as one featuring Kenji Sawada. Visual comparison with known images of Sawada confirmed his role as the headlined performer, with Lena appearing as a guest. The process involved cross-referencing multiple sources and carefully avoiding speculation, ensuring that the information presented here is as accurate and respectful as possible.</p>

<p>This post is shared in the spirit of preserving Lena’s legacy with care and honesty. She gave so much in her short life, and the least we can do is treat her story with the dignity it deserves.</p>
