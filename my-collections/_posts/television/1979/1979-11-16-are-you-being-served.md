<h2 id="infobox4"><a href="#infobox4">BBC Genome: An example of how the BBC care so little about broadcast history</a></h2>
<p>The sitcom was broadcast on BBC One, yet due to the poor way the BBC schedules pages are managed, it is made to look as though the show was first broadcast on BBC Two. This demonstrates how little care the BBC takes with its own history. It also makes research unnecessarily difficult for anyone interested in past programmes.</p>
<p>The problem is simple to fix. The schedules section of the BBC website should only list upcoming broadcasts, rather than sending its content to the Genome Project site via the BBC’s internal API. This would prevent contradictory information about which channel a programme was originally shown on.</p>
<p>A better solution, given the BBC’s desire to link programmes currently available on iPlayer, would be to ensure that content from the schedules pages is displayed on the related Genome Project page in a separate section. That way, it would be clear that the information relates to current broadcasts, not the original transmission.</p>
