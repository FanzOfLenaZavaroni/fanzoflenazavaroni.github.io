<p>My feedback to the BBC on "...Sings Neil Diamond</p>

<p>Pleased to see that this programme is getting another repeat broadcast. While I enjoy all the singers in the programme, I wish to inform the BBC that there is still a large number of fans that remember Lena Zavaroni and would love to see her shows get repeated as currently we only get to see her in "...Sings Neil Diamond and once in a while when you repeat the two of the three episodes of TOTP she performed on.</p>

<p>This year is the 20th anniversary of her death so an in-depth documentary would also be in order. Ideally with Louis Theroux as I feel he would be up to asking the difficult questions that have so far gone unanswered.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading my feedback,</p>

<p>Robcamstone (Fanz of Lena Zavaroni).</p>

<p>Content of eMail:</p>

<p>Hi Robert, Thank you for getting in touch, it's lovely to hear from you!</p>

<p>I appreciate that you feel the BBC should add programmes regarding Lena Zavaroni to their output, it's amazing to read of such passion for her and her work. As much as I would like to be able to fulfil your wishes, I'm afraid that I am in no position to make any promises.</p>

<p>That said, we always appreciate it when people share their ideas and make suggestions. This is what shapes the direction and the future of the BBC.</p>

<p>You may wish to keep an eye on BBC Media Centre. All information about new and upcoming programmes can be found there. Here's the link: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre">http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre</a></p>

### Note:
...Sings Neil Diamond was scheduled for a broadcast on BBC Four on the 23 March 2019 at 00:30 but the broadcast never went ahead why I don't know. When the BBC pulls a broadcast it just updates the TV listings for the day and does not indicate that a programme had been pulled or the reason why.
