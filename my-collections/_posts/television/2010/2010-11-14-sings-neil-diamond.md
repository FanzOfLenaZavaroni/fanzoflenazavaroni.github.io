<blockquote>
<p>At the time of the original broadcast the BBC Channels were still broadcasting in Standard Definition (SD) for high definition (HD) viewers would have to watch BBC HD which was a channel that showed a selection of programmes from across the BBC's' other channels so limited in what was showed.</p>

<h2 id="infobox4"><a href="#infobox4">Even the editor of the page for ...Sings Neil Diamond is confused</a></h2>
<p>...Sings Neil Diamond may have got it's first HD broadcast on 19 November 2016 (unable to confirm as even to this day the BBC broadcasts SD content on its HD channels, Yes it's currently on BBC iPlayer in HD but it may just be upscaled from SD): <a class="external-link" href="https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/service_bbc_four/2016-11-19#at-0.50">BBC Genome</a> / <a class="external-link" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/schedules/p00fzl6b/2016/11/19">BBC Listing Page</a> and just to confuse the issue the BBC Page for ...Sings Neil Diamond gives the date as the 20th so even the editor of the page is confused by how the BBC lists it's programmes as they ignore the fact that the date changes as midnight.</p>
<p>In the world as we know it the programme was broadcast on the 20 November 2016 but in the BBC listings it is listed under the 19 November 2016 but whoever edited this page used the real world date that does not work on the BBC website as if you go to the 20 November 2016 to look for ...Sings Neil Diamond you will not find it there you have to go to the day before. This is also true of a number of other dates and programmes so if you are researching content always remember to check the day before in the BBC listings.</p>

<p>My feedback to the BBC on "...Sings Neil Diamond</p>

<p>Pleased to see that this programme is getting another repeat broadcast. While I enjoy all the singers in the programme, I wish to inform the BBC that there is still a large number of fans that remember Lena Zavaroni and would love to see her shows get repeated as currently we only get to see her in "...Sings Neil Diamond and once in a while when you repeat the two of the three episodes of TOTP she performed on.</p>

<p>This year is the 20th anniversary of her death so an in-depth documentary would also be in order. Ideally with Louis Theroux as I feel he would be up to asking the difficult questions that have so far gone unanswered.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading my feedback,</p>

<p>Robcamstone (Fanz of Lena Zavaroni).</p>

<p>BBC Reply to my email giving feedback on "...Sings Neil Diamond"</p>

<p>Content of eMail:</p>

<p>Hi Robert, Thank you for getting in touch, it's lovely to hear from you!</p>

<p>I appreciate that you feel the BBC should add programmes regarding Lena Zavaroni to their output, it's amazing to read of such passion for her and her work. As much as I would like to be able to fulfil your wishes, I'm afraid that I am in no position to make any promises.</p>

<p>That said, we always appreciate it when people share their ideas and make suggestions. This is what shapes the direction and the future of the BBC.</p>

<p>You may wish to keep an eye on BBC Media Centre. All information about new and upcoming programmes can be found there. Here's the link: <a class="external-link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre">http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre</a></p>

### Note:
...Sings Neil Diamond was scheduled for a broadcast on BBC Four on the 23 March 2019 at 00:30 but the broadcast never went ahead why I don't know. When the BBC pulls a broadcast it just updates the TV listings for the day and does not indicate that a programme had been pulled or the reason why.
