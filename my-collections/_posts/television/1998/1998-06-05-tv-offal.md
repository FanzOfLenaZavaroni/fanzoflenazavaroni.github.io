<p>TV comedy series narrated by Victor Lewis-Smith, which poked fun at television shows down the years.</p>
<p>Series 1, Episode 3 contained a clip of Lena's appearance on the Golden Shot in 1974, Lewis Smith claimed that Lena was actually a teenage girl disguised as a child <a class="subscript-small warning" href="#infobox4">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>It also contained a mock shooting of Lena, and a spoof interview with Hughie Green in which crude references to Lena were made <a class="subscript-small warning" href="#infobox5">[2]</a>.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Comments are just that, comments and are not meant to be taken as facts.</p>
<p id="infobox4"><strong>Child:</strong> This joke actually shows that the views some fans have on how Lena Zavaroni was dressed younger than she was, was also notice by some in the world of show business.</p>
<p id="infobox5"><strong>Crude:</strong> While the Crudeness is deeply offensive, there may be a hard truth within it, as some may know Lena had issues when it came to sexual relationships and so this may be an attempt to open up the can of worms as to whether or not Lena had been sexually abused.</p>
<p>Sadly I would not be surprised because as we all know she had faced most other types of abuse throughout her life.</p>
