<p><strong>Note:</strong> Don't use the current BBC listings for getting details on old programmes as if like "The Morecambe And Wise Show" the BBC has repeated a single episode on a different channel they may decide to list all broadcasts on that channel even though it's was not the main channel for the original broadcast.</p>
<p>That is why for "The Morecambe And Wise Show Episode 9.3" the broadcast date is correct but it seem to show it was on BBC Two for that date which is wrong, Adding BBC One next to the date would fix this misleading detail.</p>
<p>The BBC have left out that important fact so it looks like on the 11 February 1976 "The Morecambe And Wise Show" was show on BBC Two <strong>it was not</strong> and just because it's a listings page does not mean it can have misleading details.</p>
