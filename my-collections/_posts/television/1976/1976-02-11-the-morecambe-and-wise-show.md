<h2 id="infobox1"><a href="#infobox1">Note</a></h2>
<p>Don't use the current BBC listings for getting details on old programmes. For shows like <em>The Morecambe And Wise Show</em>, the BBC has repeated episodes on different channels and now lists all broadcasts under that repeat channel – even if it wasn’t the original one.</p>
<p>That’s why for Episode 9.3, the listing shows it aired on <strong>BBC Two</strong> on <strong>11 February 1976</strong>, which is <strong>wrong</strong>. It was originally broadcast on <strong>BBC One</strong>. Adding “BBC One” next to the date would fix this misleading detail.</p>
<p>The BBC has left out that crucial fact, so it now looks like the show aired on BBC Two, <strong>it did not</strong>. Just because it’s a listings page doesn’t mean it should misrepresent broadcast history.</p>
<p>This is yet another example of the BBC showing it doesn’t care about getting its own history right.</p>
