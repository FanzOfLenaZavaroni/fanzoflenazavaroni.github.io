>
>Tonight, as part of the BBC's mental health season, children's TV presenter Michaela Strachan tells Professor Anthony Clare about her teenage anorexia.
>
> Michaela recalls her first day at dance school, when her teacher told members of the group that they were either "too fat" or "too thin". From then on, she found that she could survive on less and less food and, eventually, discovered she wasn't hungry.
>
