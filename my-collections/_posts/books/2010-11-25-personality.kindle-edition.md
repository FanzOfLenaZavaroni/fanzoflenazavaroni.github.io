<ul>
<li><p><strong>Sunday Times:</strong> An enormously impressive, frequently curious and consistently ambitious novel.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Guardian:</strong> Personality plucks a wealth of literary art . . . What he manages brilliantly is allowing us only restricted access to Maria's mind, so that the reader is put in something like the same relation to her as the sharkish agents and managers who suck her dry.'</p></li>
<li><p><strong>New York Review of Books:</strong> There is boldness and beauty in this finely wrought merging of mythical epic, historical resonance and contemporary detail, and it is emblematic of O'Hagan's wider ambition . . . Few young novelists would have the nerve to undertake such a task and fewer still could accomplish it with such command, such grace, and such compassion.</p></li>
