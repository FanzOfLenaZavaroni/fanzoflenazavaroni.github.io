<blockquote>
<p>Not every child star enjoyed a subsequent happy life. Lena Zavaroni was only 10 when she won Opportunity Knocks for a record five weeks in a row in 1974. She went on to have an album in the Top Ten, appeared with Morecambe and Wise and sang for President Gerald Ford at the White House.</p>
<p>But her career stuggled once her teens were over and she went on to develop severe anorexia and depression. Zavaroni died of pneumonia aged <s>36&nbsp;</s> 35 and weighing less than five stone.</p>
<cite>Note: The article states her age at death as 36 it is incorrect Lena was 35.</cite>
