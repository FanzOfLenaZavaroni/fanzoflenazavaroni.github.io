<blockquote>
<p><strong>The most successful talent-spotting show of all time</strong></p>
<p>Opportunity Knocks was first launched on BBC radio in 1949 when it gave a lift up the ladder to the likes of Spike Milligan and Frankie Vaughan.</p>
<p>On television between 1956 and 1977, it produced acts of the calibre of Bonnie Langford, <span style="text-decoration: underline dashed darkorange 3px;">Lena Zavaroni</span>, Les Dawson, Freddie Starr, Su Pollard, Frank Carson and Little and Large.</p>
<p>It was the most successful talent-spotting show ever and 10,000 acts were auditioned each year but just 175 got their chance to appear on the box.</p>
<p>Hughie Green hosted the television version on ITV until 1978 before the show was revived on the BBC in the late 1980s with Bob Monkhouse and Les Dawson.</p>
<p>The winning acts on Opportunity Knocks were decided by the viewing public.</p>
<p>In the ITV version this took the form of a postal vote, the winner of which was announced the following week.</p>
<p>The BBC revival was notable for being the first TV show to decide its winner using the now-standard method of a telephone vote.</p>
