<p>Contemporary press coverage suggested Dee Anne was auditioning for a BBC show titled <em>Search for a Star</em>. However, the series that aired was produced by London Weekend Television (LWT) for ITV, indicating either a shift in production or a misreporting in early articles. No known recording or broadcast of her performance has surfaced, and her connection to the Solomons remains unconfirmed.</p>
