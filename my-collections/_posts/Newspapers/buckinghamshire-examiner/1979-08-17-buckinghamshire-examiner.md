<li>The Examer article claims the 13-year-old, Hartlepool-born singer could be on her way to fame and fortune thanks to the newspaper.</li>
<li>it also claims that Phillip Solomon, whose company manages Lena Zavaroni among others was impressed with an audition tape for a new BBC series <strong>Search for a Star</strong> which it claims she passed and that due to the audition tape Phillip Solomon wanted to met her and her family as well as her manager Diane Rowley to discuss terms.</li>
<li>It also informs us of how she brought the house down during the Miss Chesham contest and that she may get to perform again at Chesham as part of a public "cabaret-style" TV audition that her manager Diane Rowley hopes to put on at Elgiva Hall to showcase eight of her artists.</li>

<li>The Examer article goes on to boost Solomon and why they think it would be a positive thing for Dee Anne to be managed by Solomon. It also opens up the questions I have asked before on how was <a href="/1963-11-04-lena-zavaroni/#infobox12">Lena Zavaroni really discovered</a> as if as stated Solomon have been given access to the BBC audition tape of Dee Anne then could he also have been informed of Lena Zavaroni back in the day by Hughie Green or someone else working on Opportunity Knocks but wanted to keep such a connection hidden&#8253;</li>
<li>while the article suggested Dee Anne was auditioning for a BBC show titled <strong>Search for a Star</strong> the series that aired was produced by London Weekend Television (LWT) for ITV, indicating either a shift in production or a misreporting in the article. No known broadcast of her performance on the audition tape has surfaced, and she was never appeared on any of  London Weekend Television (LWT) broadcasts of the show also her connection to the Solomons remains unconfirmed.</li>
<li>There are no other details on "cabaret-style" TV audition such as what if any TV company had an agreement to host such a show and given it was a hope it seems unlikely anything came of the plain.</li>
<li>Apart from the articles by the Examer which are hidden behide paywalls no public information on Dee Anne seems to be available so I can't even confirm at this time if here career took off or if she is still even singing/performing.</li>

<p>The performers listed below were all associated with Phil Solomon and his wife Dorothy, both known for managing young musical talent during the 1960s and 1970s. Dee Anne (possibly Deanne Blazey) appeared in press coverage with similar aspirations, but her connection to the Solomons remains unconfirmed, and her career trajectory is unclear.</p>
