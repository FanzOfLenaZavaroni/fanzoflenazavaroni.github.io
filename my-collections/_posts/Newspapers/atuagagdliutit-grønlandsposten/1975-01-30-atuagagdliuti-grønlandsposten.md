maintitle: AG Atuagagdliutit/Grønlandsposten
subtitle: The Greenland Post
after: " - Dated unconfirmed I based the date on the fact that 3 February 1975 was the earliest date in the Radio listings which would mean that the paper had to be released before that date and as it only comes out on Tuesdays and Thursdays the closest date is the 30 January 1975."
description: The paper is only published twice a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

<strong>Note:</strong> This post is a work in progress so all details are subject to change as and when I can locate more details during my research.

Currently unable to translate Kalaallisut (Greenlandic language) but as the paper publishes the articles twice once in Kalaallisut and again in Danish it means we can translate the details from the Danish sections.

See the related <a class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atuagagdliutit/Gr%C3%B8nlandsposten">wikipedia</a> page for more details on the paper.

"Atuagagdliutit" is in Kalaallisut while "Grønlandsposten" is in Danish and translates as "The Greenland Post".

<p>Currently we have no indication as to what two radio channels Lena sang on the reason I believe it's Radio and not Television is that the related page heading translates as Radio Programs.</p>
<p>Unconfirmed but the most likely Radio broadcaster is "<a class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalaallit_Nunaata_Radioa">Kalaallit Nunaata Radioa</a>" also known by its abbreviation KNR, it is Greenland's national public broadcasting organization which launched c1958. KNR TV launched c1982</p>
