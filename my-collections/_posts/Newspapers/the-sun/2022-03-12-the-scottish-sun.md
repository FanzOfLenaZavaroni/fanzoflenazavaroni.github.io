<blockquote>
<p>The entertainer, who played Cat in the cult BBC Sci-fi series about a gang of misfits onboard a spacecraft, landed his big break as a dancer for the Scots singing sensation’s seventies telly specials.</p>
<p>And Danny insists it helped to make him a star in his own right after he planted a peck on the teenager’s cheek during the primetime show.</p>
<p>The 61-year-old, who will tour Scotland this month in the stage version of the Da Vinci Code, says: “Lena Zavaroni was one of the biggest stars in telly and I started my career as one of her dancers at the BBC.</p>
<p>“When we were doing one of her shows, where she sang Queen’s Don’t Stop Me Now, me and another dancer gave her in a lift at the end of the number.</p>
<p>“But the producer Stewart Morris said, ‘When you drop her down, I want you two to give her a kiss on the cheek.’</p>
<p>“Now this was the 70s with the British National Front out on the streets and he wanted a black guy to give little Lena Zavaroni a kiss?</p>
<p>“The other dancer bottled it, but I gave her a kiss on the cheek. It was like a revelation.</p>
<p>“The next day I was walking down the street and my mates are coming up going ‘Dan - you kissed Lena Zavaroni on telly, what the hell man.’’</p>
<p>“It was the biggest moment to happen in my career at that point. Because things like that didn’t happen on TV in those days.”</p>
