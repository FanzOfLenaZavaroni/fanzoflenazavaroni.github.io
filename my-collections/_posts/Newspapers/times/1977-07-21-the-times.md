<div class="CardItem split">
<p>Stanley Reynolds compares <strong>Night Out at The London Casino</strong> with <strong>Sunday Night at the London Palladium</strong> as the Master of Ceremonies Tom O'Connor tells Jokes and runs audience participation quiz games.</p>
<p>Stanley Reynolds questions why Thames TV would want to restore a incredibly boring show format. He was more positive that Tommy Cooper was in the show haven gotten over his recent illness and he also commented on Lorna Luft and her half sister Liza Minelli while admitting he was not a fan of Judy Garland (Which puts into question his criticism of the show clearly not a unbiased criticism.)</p>
<p>The final part of the review makes reference to the BBC's First Episode of "<a href="/1977-07-17-hi-summer">Hi! Summer</a>" which had been broadcast on the 17th just three days before the broadcast of "Night Out at the London Casino".</p>
