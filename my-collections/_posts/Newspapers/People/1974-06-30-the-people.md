<div class="CardItem split">
<p>Summary based on the original article published on 30 June 1974.</p>
<p>A glimpse into the Kray twins' rigid prison routine reveals a blend of strict structure and small comforts: weight training, reading, and watching films. Highlights include their fondness for Olympic gymnast Olga Korbut and singer Lena Zavaroni, along with their mother's tireless efforts to reunite them after years in separate prisons. Rumours of their lingering influence are dispelled by those close to them, who describe a far quieter life behind bars.</p>
