<p>SINGER Lena Zavaroni faced double heartache last night as she arrived in Scotland for the funeral of her mother.</p>
<p>For her family claimed that Lena's happy wedding two months ago triggered off a fit of depression in her 47-year-old mother Hilda, found dead on Friday from a massive drug overdose.</p>
<p>Lena's near-blind grandfather Peter Jordan, 66, said in Rothesay, Isle of Bute: "Hilda was a wee bit lost after Lena married.</p>
<p>There had always been Lena and now she had found a man.</p>
<p>"I expected Hilda to come and tell me all about the wedding. I thought she would be full of it. But she never got in touch."</p>
<p><Strong>However, Mr Jordan was not certain his daughter had committed suicide.</strong></p>
<p>He said: "There was an empty bottle of pills beside her. But I'm not sure about suicide. Maybe she'd forgotten she'd already taken pills."</p>
<p>Mrs Zavaroni had lived alone in Rothesay since splitting with musician husband Victor.</p>
<p>He has since remarried and lives with second wife Christine in Finchley, north London, near Lena and her husband Peter Wiltshire, 27.</p>
<p>Lena, 25, fought for years against the slimmers' disease anorexia.</p>
<p>A friend said last night: "This will knock her sideways."</p>
