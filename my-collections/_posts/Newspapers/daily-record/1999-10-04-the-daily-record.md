### Article excerpt
> LENA ZAVARONI was to marry as soon as she recovered from the operation she hoped would give her the normal life she craved.
>
> Close friend Ray Dexter, who had cared for the former child singing star for three years, proposed to her last Wednesday as she lay in a hospital bed.
>
> Anorexic Miss Zavaroni, recovering from a leuchotomy, a rarely performed procedure similar to a lobotomy, said yes.
>
> Yet two days later she died from a chest infection which her frail four-stone body was unable to fight. 'I held her hand and asked her. She looked at me and smiled and said yes,' said Mr Dexter, a 49-year-old musician. 'I was overjoyed and couldn't wait for her to get better. The last thing she said to me was "I love you Ray, thanks" as I left on Thursday.
>
> 'The next day she got the infection and had great difficulty breathing.
>
> Even then, I was certain that she would be all right. But she was too tired and too weak to fight. If she only had a couple of extra pounds then she may have been strong enough, but she just slipped away from us all.
>
> 'We had talked about marriage before but I never found the courage to ask her. I left it until it was far too late.' Miss Zavaroni, 35, became a star after winning Opportunity Knocks at the age of ten. In her brief career she met Frank Sinatra, had a Number One hit with Ma, He's Making Eyes At Me and performed for the Queen at the Royal Variety Show.
>
> In 1989 Lena married Peter Wiltshire but the marriage lasted only 18 months after he admitted he could not cope with caring for a sick woman.
>
> Lena told a close friend: 'Peter knew I was ill when we got married.
>
> I really loved him and believed I was quite well again. Of course I was depressed after my marriage ended. Who wouldn't be? I just wanted to be loved.' It was her unusual childhood, and the pressures on her not to grow up, that led to anorexia. â€¦
