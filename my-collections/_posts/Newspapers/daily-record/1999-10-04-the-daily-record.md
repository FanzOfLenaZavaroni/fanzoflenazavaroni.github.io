        <p>This article, published shortly after Lena Zavaroni’s death, reported that musician Ray Dexter had proposed to her while she was in hospital recovering from a leucotomy. According to Dexter, Lena accepted his proposal just two days before she passed away from a chest infection. He described their final moments together and expressed regret that he had waited so long to ask her. The article also reflected on Lena’s earlier marriage to Peter Wiltshire and the emotional toll of her illness and fame.</p>
