<p>LENA ZAVARONI had arrived on the doorstep in a pair of slippers, wearing a flimsy coat and a nightdress over her pitifully thin body.</p>
<p>It was two weeks before the former child star was due to have her high-risk brain operation and she had travelled alone from Euston to Birmingham to be close to her best friend Elaine Dalziel.</p>
<p>Yesterday, an inquest heard that the Rothesay-born singer - whose weight had dropped to three and a half stone - died of pneumonia.</p>
<p>There is no evidence - yet - that the surgery was directly related to her death, but more tests are to be done.</p>
<p>When Lena's father Victor called Elly last Friday and broke the news of her death, Elly was distraught - but not surprised.</p>
<p>"I think the operation was Lena's death wish," she says.</p>
<p>"In the two weeks that we spent together before she went into hospital, she had talked about dying and although I don't think she wanted to go through with the surgery, she had explained to me that it was her only hope of a release from the anorexia and from the fear of not being in control of her life."</p>
<p>Elly was the woman who had shared much of Lena's life, becoming so close that she had even changed her name to Zavaroni.</p>
<p>A fellow anorexic, they had become best friends when they starred in a pantomime in the 80s.</p>
<p>They had made a pact to keep an eye on each other's paltry food intake and to never grow up.</p>
<p>"We just didn't feel that we fitted into the adult world. The anorexia was our way of keeping our bodies like children's. It was a kind of protection," said Elly.</p>
