<h2 id="infobox1"><a href="#infobox1">About The Article</a></h2>

<p>The article talks about a new talent show, but it was written before the first episode was shown. The writer had no way to know what the format was, so most of what was written is guesswork. The writer compared it to old shows and old problems, but didn’t show that the new show is actually like any of them. It reads more like the writer didn’t like the idea of talent shows in general. Because of that, the article isn’t a review. It’s just an opinion based on nothing that had aired yet.</p>

<p>The article also had a small photo of Ronan Keating with the caption “Mr Nice Guy: Ronan Keating.” The preview didn’t even name the programme, but the show was called “Get Your Act Together.”</p>
