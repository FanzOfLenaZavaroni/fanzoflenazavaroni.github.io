<strong style="color:#FF0000;">Article Warning:</strong> Personal views may be upsetting to some fans.
<strong>The monument that’s not a monument</strong>
<p>While Alison Smith did her best to provide a monument in spite of the lack of funds adding a plaque to a statue found in a garden centre is hardly a fitting monument for such a great star as Lena Zavaroni undoubtedly was.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the article does not mention if she approached Argyll and Bute Council to see if they would contribute to the monument of a star that had help put Bute on the map as it were, it was the least Lena’s hometown could have down.</p>
<p>While Victor and Carla attended the opening, we don’t know if Alison approached Victor for help with the funding, as Lena’s father I would have thought he could have use some of the money from the inheritance he received after his daughter’s death to insure a more fitting monument.</p>
<p>Our memories can only be enrich if we take the time to share them otherwise they will just become forgotten.</p>
