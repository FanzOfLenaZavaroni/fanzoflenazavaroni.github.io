<strong>RTL festival in pictures BY HARRIE CREMERS</strong>
<p>ESSEN-GELSENKIRCHEN — Via the television screen (ZDF — "Die Drehscheibe") you already received some flashes of the RTL festival, the Löwenverleihung" of Radio Luxembourg in the Grugahal in Essen last night.</p>
<p>More than 15,000 fans followed this spectacle, which LD's show page shows today with some nice photos.</p>
<p>A number of well-known stars with whom I spoke afterwards at the midnight party in the Maritim hotel in Gelsenkirchen will reveal in the Limburgs Dagblad in the coming days what plans they have for the near future.</p>
<p>THE ARTISTS who performed in Essen were: the English group MUD, the Spanish formation SANTABARBARA, BERND CLÜVER, JüRGEN MARCUS, the band of JAMES LAST, GÜNTHER KALMANN-KOOR, CHRISTIAN ANDERS, ABBA from Sweden, UDO JÜRGENS, 10-year old <span style="text-decoration: underline dashed darkorange 3px;">LENA ZAVARONI</span>, GTJNTER GABRIël, HOWARD CARPENDALE and the orchestra "Die Studiker". Guests were PEGGY MARCH and PETER ORLOFF. JOCHEN, HELGA and RAINER HOLBE (employee of RTL and ZDF) provided the presentation.</p>

<p>The artists who were awarded honorary, gold, silver and bronze lions by radio director FRANK ELSTNER were Abba, James Last, Jürgen Marcus, Christian Anders and Bernd Clüver.</p>
