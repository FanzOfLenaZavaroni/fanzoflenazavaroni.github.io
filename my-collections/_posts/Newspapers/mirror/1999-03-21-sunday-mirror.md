### SECRET RAPE NIGHTMARE OF SINGER LENA'S MOTHER

> THE mother of Seventies singing sensation Lena Zavaroni was the victim of a brutal rape, the Sunday Mirror can reveal.
>
> And the shock of the assault - when Lena was at the height of her fame - may have prompted the former child star's decline.
>
> Lena's mum Hilda was attacked when she went home to Rothesay on the Isle of Bute after staying with Lena in London.
>
> The rape has been revealed by Hilda's father, Peter Jordon, because he believes it caused the breakdown of her marriage to Lena's father Victor, her lonely death in 1989 - and to Lena's anorexia and severe depression.
>
> "Lena was about 15 or 16 when her mother was attacked. She was appearing at the Palladium, going to Hollywood, all that," said Mr Jordon, 76. "But after her mother was attacked, Lena seemed to go down hill. I don't know whether it was just coincidence or what.
>
> "People said she got the eating disorder because she couldn't handle the fame. But the terrible thing that happened to her mother must have affected her."
>
> Recalling the tragedy, Mr Jordan said: "Hilda came to see me; she was in a terrible state. She said a man had entered the room she was staying in at the Black Bull pub.
>
> "The details she told me are just too horrible to describe. But she was brutally raped, that's a fact. And no one was ever convicted of the attack. In the end Hilda caved in; she just couldn't take the pressure. She told the police not to proceed."

<!--
> Mr Jordon added: "When Lena became a star, Hilda and Victor went to London with her to look after her. Hilda tried to make a go at singing, but she would ring and say she wasn't getting much money.
>
> "She wasn't happy at all. Lena was staying with her agents in a posh London flat. I think Hilda felt as though she'd been sidelined. Hilda came back to Bute by herself. She seemed happier being home. All that changed after the attack."
>
> Mr Jordon, who lives alone in a council house on Bute, said: "Hilda never got over it. Then her marriage collapsed. She was living alone in a flat when she died. She had been dead for three days when they found her. People said she committed suicide because there was an empty bottle of pills on the table, but the post mortem said she died of a heart attack.
>
> "Lena came to the funeral. It was the first time I had seen her for years. She was so thin. After the funeral we went to a hotel. I remember Lena taking a bit of food and spitting into her hankie.
>
> "I told her to start eating properly and to look after herself. But she just stared at me with blank eyes.
>
> "We talked about her mother for a bit. I mentioned the attack. It was the first time we had spoken about it.
>
> "Lena just looked very sad, but she didn't say much. I think she'd blanked it out of her mind."
>
> Yesterday Lena said she believed she had inherited her own slimming illness from her late mum.
>
> "My mother was ill for a long time and just couldn't cope," said Lena. "I now believe that my own problems may be genetically linked.""
>
> Lena, 35, was in the news recently when she was falsely accused of stealing a jelly from a supermarket near her council flat a few miles outside London.
>
> It was revealed she is living on pounds 48.20 state benefits and that she was suffering from deep depression.
>
> Pictures of her emaciated figure shocked millions who remember her as the tiny star with a huge voice who belted out Top 10 hits such as Ma, He's Making Eyes At Me.
>
> She was just nine when she won the talent show Opportunity Knocks for a record five weeks. Later she appeared with Frank Sinatra and Liza Minnelli and sang for President Ford at the White House.
>
> Lena had her own TV show and was the youngest star to top the bill at the London Palladium. Then came her dramatic decline. After her parents' divorce her weight plunged to just four stones.
>
> She said recently that she may be suffering from a rare brain disorder that makes her "feel dead inside".
>
> "It's as though my emotions are dead and new tests are indicating that it is way beyond anything like clinical depression," Lena said.
>
> But her grandfather said: "I'd like to pass on a message to Lena to come home for a while. Perhaps we could talk and sort things out.
>
> "Lena seems so unhappy. But she needn't be. There is a lot of love for her here."
