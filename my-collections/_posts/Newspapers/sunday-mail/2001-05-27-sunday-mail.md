<blockquote>
<p>THE father of Scots singer Lena Zavaroni has moved back to her childhood home on the Isle of Bute.</p>
<p>But Victor Zavaroni, who had moved south to be nearer his daughter, says he will always regret not returning to Rothesay sooner - and bringing tragic Lena with him.</p>
<p>The former child star, whose life was plagued by the eating disorder anorexia nervosa, died in 1999, aged 36. She weighed four stones.</p>
<p>Speaking from his home overlooking the Kyles of Bute, Victor, 61, said: "Lena would be pleased to see me back, but if only things had been different, she would have been here, too.</p>
<p>"I've been away 21 years, but feel particularly at peace here. It's as if the years have all melted away."</p>
<p>It was during a visit to the island at New Year that Victor and Christine, his second wife, decided the time was right to return to Rothesay.</p>
