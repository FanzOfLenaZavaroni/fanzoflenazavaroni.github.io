<blockquote>
<p>THE father of Scots singer Lena Zavaroni has moved back to her childhood home on the Isle of Bute.</p>
<p>But Victor Zavaroni, who had moved south to be nearer his daughter, says he will always regret not returning to Rothesay sooner - and bringing tragic Lena with him.</p>
<p>The former child star, whose life was plagued by the eating disorder anorexia nervosa, died in 1999, aged 36. She weighed four stones.</p>
<p>Speaking from his home overlooking the Kyles of Bute, Victor, 61, said: "Lena would be pleased to see me back, but if only things had been different, she would have been here, too.</p>
<p>"I've been away 21 years, but feel particularly at peace here. It's as if the years have all melted away."</p>
<p>It was during a visit to the island at New Year that Victor and Christine, his second wife, decided the time was right to return to Rothesay.</p>
<p>He said: "We were out one day and saw the for sale sign outside this house, and I thought: 'What a fantastic view.'</p>
<p>"It's a really quiet spot and that's one of the reasons I came back - it's so quiet and peaceful."</p>
<p>In a moving interview, Victor described the trauma of his daughter's troubled life and agonising death.</p>
<p>He revealed how he hoped in vain that Lena would recover from anorexia and, ultimately, return to Rothesay to be among the people who loved her.</p>
<p>Victor said: "I think Rothesay is the kind of place where a lot of people do leave - but always come back."</p>
