<p>The article featured a large headline, <strong>In love with death!</strong>, along with a photograph of Lena Zavaroni, despite the accompanying article being unrelated to her.</p>
<p>The only scan I could find is too poor to read the article's text, but the layout illustrates how newspapers often used an artist's image to illustrate anorexia‑related stories that did not concern them.</p>
<p>This happened to both Lena Zavaroni and Karen Carpenter all the time, not only exploiting their public image but potentially adding indirectly to their ongoing health issues.</p>
