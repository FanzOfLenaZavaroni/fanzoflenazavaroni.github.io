<p><strong>Little girl A lost</strong></p>
<p>by Eric Redfern</p>
<p>The Eastbourne Gazette’s editorial reflects on Lena Zavaroni's performance at the Congress Theatre on 13 July 1975. Drawing large audiences, her appearances were met with overwhelming enthusiasm, marked by cheers and applause that rarely grace the venue. The article acknowledges the challenge faced by child performers — many of whom enjoy fleeting fame — while contemplating Lena’s potential longevity in showbusiness.</p>
<p>It notes the maturity in Lena’s stage presence despite her youth, highlighting how confidently she handled the spotlight. One poignant image from the show lingers in the journalist’s memory: Lena standing alone on the vast stage, seemingly vulnerable yet undeterred. The piece frames this moment as emblematic of the resilience and dedication required in the entertainment world.</p>
