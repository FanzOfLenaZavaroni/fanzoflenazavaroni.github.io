<p>According to the article in the <strong>Eastbourne Herald</strong>, Lena Zavaroni was scheduled to make her debut at Eastbourneâ€™s Congress Theatre as part of a Sunday evening variety show. Having risen to fame through <strong>Opportunity Knocks</strong>, her appearance followed a successful tour of America earlier in the year. She shared the bill with comedian <strong>Norman Collier</strong>, known locally for previous summer seasons at the same venue.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The concert featuring Lena Zavaroni and Norman Collier was also advertised in the <strong>Bexhill-on-Sea Observer</strong> dated 12 July 1975.
