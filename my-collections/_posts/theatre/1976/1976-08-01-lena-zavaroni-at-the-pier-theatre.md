<p>It was significantly damaged by a storm in 1978, which separated the pier head and shelter, leading to their demolition. However, the pier itself wasn't completely destroyed, and it has undergone various renovations and refurbishments since then. The current pier is a mix of different sections, including the original Victorian main deck, the 1948 central pier deck, and the 1970s entrance pavilion. New owners have announced plans to extend the pier to its original length and restore it to its "former glory".</p>

<p>In 1978, Skegness Pier suffered significant damage due to a severe storm that washed away two large sections, isolating the pier head. This event marked a turning point in the pier's history, leading to the demolition of the damaged parts in the mid-1980s due to the high costs of restoration. The remaining structure was largely land-based, and a portion of the pier caught fire during the demolition process.</p>
