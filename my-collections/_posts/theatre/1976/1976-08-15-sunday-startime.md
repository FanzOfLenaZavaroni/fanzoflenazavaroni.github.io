<p>A "Turn" refers to an individual performance or act in a variety show, showcasing different talents and entertainment styles. Set order of Turns currently unknown.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Johnny Wiltshire Orchestra</li>
<li>The Vernons</li>
<li>Tony Evans</li>
<li>Barley</li>
<li>Barry Britten</li>
<li>Pam Ayres</li>
<li>Lena Zavaroni</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> While I have not been able to confirm the type of show at this time, given the type of performer Lena's managers had set Lena up to be, the use of variety show and referring to the performers as Turns seems like the best fit at this time, but visitors to this website should treat such details as unconfirmed.</p>
