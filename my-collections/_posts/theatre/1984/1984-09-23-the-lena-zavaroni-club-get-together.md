Members of the Lena Zavaroni Club have an afternoon 'get together', where Lena is the guest of honour.

The get together was planed as a picnic in Green Park, London but rain on the day put a stop to that and it was moved to a nearby hotel between 3.30pm-5.00pm Lena joins the fans and she chats to them and signs autographs.
