<p>The Winter Gardens (1911) was built in a specially excavated hollow so as not to block the view of the sea from Fort Crescent. This photo shows the extent to which this succeeded.</p>

<p>Summary of the BBC News Article</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Margate’s Grade-II listed Winter Gardens, closed since August 2022 after Your Leisure returned its lease following financial losses, will be refurbished by Westwood One Theatre. Plans propose a sustainable, profitable multi-use venue featuring a rooftop bar, drama school, learning centre, and nursery. Thanet District Council will consider an £80,000 support grant and, after preparatory works and due diligence, a £4 million refurbishment grant at its 20 March meeting.</p>
