* —— **Guest Star:** Lena Zavaroni.
* —— **Theatre Producer:** [Harold Fielding](/biography/harold-fielding).
* —— **Contract Signatory:** Victor Zavaroni director of Lena Zavaroni Public Limited Company (PLC).
     * —— It is interesting to note Victor Zavaroni signed contracts for Lena and not Dorothy and/or Phil Solomon who where meant to be her managerment team and shows that Victor was more involved in Lena's career than we may think.
