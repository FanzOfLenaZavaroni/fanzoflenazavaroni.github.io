Two shows at 6.10 and 8.20pm plus a rehearsal at 2.30pm

* —— **Guest Star:** Lena Zavaroni.
* —— **Theatre Producer:** [Harold Fielding](/biography/harold-fielding).
* —— **Contract Signatory:** Victor Zavaroni director of Lena Zavaroni Public Limited Company (PLC).
     * —— It is interesting to note Victor Zavaroni signed contracts for Lena and not Dorothy and/or Phil Solomon who where meant to be her managerment team and shows that Victor was more involved in Lena's career than we may think.

### Unable to confirm if the show was canceled, it should have been if Lena followed the order to rest for 6 weeks.
<p>It is also posible that the show went ahead with an alternative act replacing Lena in the starring role.</p>
