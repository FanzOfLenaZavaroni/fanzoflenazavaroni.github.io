<p>A "Turn" refers to an individual performance or act in a variety show, showcasing different talents and entertainment styles.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Headliner:</strong> Lena Zavaroni</p>
<p>Songs Sung included Jump Down Jimmy, Sweet Sweet Smile, I Don't Want To Walk Without You, Ma, He's Making Eyes At Me, Somewhere Over The Rainbow, Shout and Speak To Me Pretty.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Currently Unknown:</strong> Art Sutter</li>
<li><strong>Currently Unknown:</strong> Clem Dane</li>
<li><strong>Specialty Act:</strong> The Birdman (Paul Derek)</li>
<li><strong>Comp√®re and/Or Comedian:</strong> Geoff Graham</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>  While I have not been able to confirm the type of show at this time, given the type of performer Lena's managers had set Lena up to be, the use of variety show and referring to the performers as Turns seems like the best fit at this time, but visitors to this website should treat such details as unconfirmed, at this time am also unable to confrim the performance order of each Turn.</p>

<p>The reason why there are so many inknowns and why it been a while since I done any work on this website is that now that we are forced to use searches that have been filted by so called AI evrything you get is misleading or a complete lie by the so called AI.</p>
<p>I had completed this page once believing I had finally confirmed the details of each Turn with reliable sources but on checking the so called sources they in no way related to the information claimed by the now filter AI searches we are forced to use as we have not have given a option to switch back to the raw searches.</p>
<p> So it will seem it going to take me even longer than planned to update this website so that all the posts will use the card layout and not the old table sytle that is not very function for visitors on mobiles, so for now you will seen a mix of styles not what I wanted but it better to go with the mix of styles than to hide all posts that use the old layout and now on top of that work I got to deal with the fact AI is damaging search engines and increasing the work load even more for people that care about truth.</p>
