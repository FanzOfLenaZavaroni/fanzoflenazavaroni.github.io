<blockquote>
<strong>The demolition of a seafront theatre in Scarborough has begun following a long fight by campaigners to save it</strong>
<p>The Futurist opened in 1921 and hosted many artists - including famously The Beatles in 1963 - but closed in 2014.</p>
<p>Scarborough Borough Council planners decided last year to demolish the building at a cost of £4m.</p>
<p>Campaigners had hoped to run it as a charitable trust but the council said it was not sustainable as a theatrical venue.</p>
