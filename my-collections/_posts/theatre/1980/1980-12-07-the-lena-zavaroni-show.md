Lena Zavaroni stars in her own show at the Theatre Royal

Unconfirmed at this time but it may have been the Theatre Royal Drury Lane or the one at Stratford East or the one at Haymarket it's unlikely to be the Theatre Royal Glasgow as around this time Lena would have been filming in London for the BBC's [The Basil Brush Show](/1980-12-13-the-basil-brush-show) and [The Little And Large Show](/1980-12-20-the-little-and-large-show).
