Currently there is limited details on Lena's appearance at the club and as you can see from the archived comments related to this event <a class="external-link" href="https://github.com/FanzOfLenaZavaroni/fanzoflenazavaroni.github.io/discussions/106">Diamond Cabaret Club Comments Archive 1</a> and <a class="external-link" href="https://github.com/FanzOfLenaZavaroni/fanzoflenazavaroni.github.io/discussions/135">Diamond Cabaret Club Comments Archive 2</a> There was a question over the dates of the show and if in fact there was a show.

<p>The Debate over the dates started because the dates I had were for 10 - 15 November 1980 and the dates the fan site Loving Lena Zavaroni (<a class="external-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100071474175072">Facebook</a>, <a class="external-link" href="https://loving-lena-zavaroni.tumblr.com/">tumblr</a>) had were for 13 - 15 November 1980 so for aprox 3 years we could not confirm which of the dates were correct and if in fact Lena had even appeared at the Double Diamond Club or whatever it was called at the time Lena had meant to have appeared at the club.</p>
<p>I then found the advert see below in the <a href="#pontypridd-observer">Pontypridd Observer</a> which seemed to confirm the dates I had but as the club was going thought a number of management changes at this time as well as financial issues it still did not confirm anything we already knew then on the 6th November 2022 I find the advert in the <a href="#neath-guardian">Neath Guardian</a> that listed the dates as 13 - 15 November 1980 while this may explain why "Loving Lena Zavaroni" had dates that were different to the dates I had it does not explain why the adverts contradict each other.</p>
<p>It seems to be the case that it was planned that Lena would appear from the 10 - 15 November 1980 but then for some reason that we currently don't know her appearance was shorted to 13 - 15 November 1980.</p>
<p>I suggest that any visitors to this page follow the links and read the Diamond Cabaret Club Comments Archive's 1 & 2 listed <a href="#unknown">above</a>.</p>
