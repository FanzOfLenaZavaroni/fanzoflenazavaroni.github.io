<p><strong>Contract Signatory For Lena Zavaroni:</strong> Victor Zavaroni director of Lena Zavaroni Public Limited Company (PLC).</p>
<p>It's interesting to note <strong>Victor Zavaroni</strong> signed contracts for Lena and not <strong>Dorothy Solomon</strong> and/or <strong>Phil Solomon</strong> who where meant to be her management team and shows that Victor was more involved in Lena's career than we may think.</p>
