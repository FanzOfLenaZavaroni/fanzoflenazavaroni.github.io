        <p><strong>Note:</strong> The Rothesay Pavilion was the venue where Lena Zavaroni first performed, according to the widely known account of her discovery by <a href="/1963-11-04-lena-zavaroni/#infobox7">Tommy Scott and Phil Solomon</a> in 1973 – one of several versions of her early story.</p>
        <p>While no specific details of the performance have surfaced in my research, the event remains a notable point in Lena’s early career.</p>
