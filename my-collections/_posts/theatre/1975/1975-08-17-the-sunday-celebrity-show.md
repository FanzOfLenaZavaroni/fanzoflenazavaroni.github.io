<p>A "Turn" refers to an individual performance or act in a variety show, showcasing different talents and entertainment styles. Set order of Turns currently unknown.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bill Rayner and his orchestra</li>
<li>Kenny Cantor</li>
<li>Franklin and his doves</li>
<li>Walter Landauer</li>
<li>Lena Zavaroni</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> While I have not been able to confirm the type of show at this time, given the type of performer Lena's managers had set Lena up to be, the use of variety show and referring to the performers as Turns seems like the best fit at this time, but visitors to this website should treat such details as unconfirmed.</p>

<p>The Winter Gardens (1911) was built in a specially excavated hollow so as not to block the view of the sea from Fort Crescent. This photo shows the extent to which this succeeded.</p>

<p>Summary of the BBC News Article</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Margate’s Grade-II listed Winter Gardens, closed since August 2022 after Your Leisure returned its lease following financial losses, will be refurbished by Westwood One Theatre. Plans propose a sustainable, profitable multi-use venue featuring a rooftop bar, drama school, learning centre, and nursery. Thanet District Council will consider an £80,000 support grant and, after preparatory works and due diligence, a £4 million refurbishment grant at its 20 March meeting.</p>
