<p>A "Turn" refers to an individual performance or act in a variety show, showcasing different talents and entertainment styles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lena Zavaroni</li>
<li>Paul Levant Tommor Pupperts</li>
<li>Chris Hocking Band</li>
<li>Dave Arnold</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Order of Turns unknown. While I have not been able to confirm the type of show at this time, given the type of performer Lena's managers had set Lena up to be, the use of variety show and referring to the performers as Turns seems like the best fit at this time, but visitors to this website should treat such details as unconfirmed.</p>
