          <dt><strong>Diet managers</strong></dt>
          <dd>Refers to Lena’s manager putting her on a strict diet at age 10.</dd>

          <dt><strong>Age ten and no clothes to fit</strong></dt>
          <dd>Highlights how young she was and how her body was already being scrutinized and controlled.</dd>

          <dt><strong>Opp Knocks to Brain Op</strong></dt>
          <dd>A compressed timeline: from her rise to fame on Opportunity Knocks to the brain operation later in life that indirectly contributed to her death.</dd>

          <dt><strong>Only the talent mattered</strong></dt>
          <dd>Reflects how her personal well-being was often overlooked in favour of her extraordinary talent.</dd>

          <dt><strong>So that’s why the child shattered</strong></dt>
          <dd>A quiet conclusion—explaining the emotional and physical toll it all took on her.</dd>

          <dt><strong>Note on form</strong></dt>
          <dd>The poem follows the traditional Japanese Tanka structure (5-7-5-7-7 syllables). Each line adheres to this pattern, though the phrasing is modern and compressed. The form was chosen for its emotional brevity and reflective tone.</dd>
