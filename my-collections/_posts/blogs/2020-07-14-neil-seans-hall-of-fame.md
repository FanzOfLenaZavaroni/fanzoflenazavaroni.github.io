subtitle: Neil Sean takes a nostalgic look at the Famous Windmill Theatre and interviews Windmill Girl Jill Millard Shapiro
after: " - 17 October 2020 At some time between those two dates the article that references Lena was added to the Blog"
description: The Sky television programme Jameson Tonight was produced in the studio. The show was very cheaply made and basically was trying to be like Johnny Carson in the US without the great host or indeed guests. The most notable I remembered as a guest was the wonderful and gifted Lena Zavaroni plus a great actor who will always been known as the TV favourite 'Jason King' aka Peter Wyngarde.

<h3 id="note"><a href="#note">NOTE</a></h3>

No date is provide for when the Blog page was created or when it was updated or the dates new articles were added but by using the wayback machine I have found the article was not part of the blog on the 14 July 2020 but on the wayback machineâ€™s next archive of the blog one article (The Windmill Theatre) was added dated 17 October 2020 it's the one that made a reference to Lena so at some sometime between those two dates the article was added.
