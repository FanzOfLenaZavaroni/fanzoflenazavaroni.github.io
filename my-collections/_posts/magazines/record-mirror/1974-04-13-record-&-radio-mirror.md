<p><strong>Note:</strong> The next issue of the magazine dated the <a class="external-link" href="https://www.americanradiohistory.com/UK/Record-Mirror/70s/74/Record-Mirror-1974-04-13.pdf#page=02">20 April 1974</a> has a error making it unclear if Lena's single was within the Top 50 for the last time in the curent publication dated 13 April 1974 or in the next issue dated 20 April 1974 as they both show the same identical data not just for Lena's single but for all singles and album positions.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Based on details from <a class="external-link" href="https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/uk-top-40-singles-chart/19740407/750140">The Official Charts website</a> the Record and Radio Mirror dated 13 April 1974 should be the last chart listing for Lena's single so I will not be doing a separate page for the 20 April 1974.</p>
