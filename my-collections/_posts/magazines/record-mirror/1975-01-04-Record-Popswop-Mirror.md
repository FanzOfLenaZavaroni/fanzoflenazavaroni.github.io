Very young (12-year-old) legs brought in Lena Zavaroni from nowhere to chart stardom. Via that much-criticised but helpful-to-pop telly series Opportunity Knocks, little Lena stormed into the chart scene with Ma He's Making Eyes At Me and in just a few months was in Las Vegas where guys like Jack Benny and Frank Sinatra raved about her.
