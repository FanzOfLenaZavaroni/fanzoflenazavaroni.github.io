<p><strong>Lena Zavaroni</strong> certainly made an impact when she appeared on Opportunity Knocks with her Shirley Temple outfit and Shirley Bassey voice. But hers isn't just a flash-in-the-pan talent — She has recently been signed up by a major recording company who plan to bring out an album and set her well on the road to stardom.</p>
<p>Making so many television appearances has meant that Lena has had to leave her Scottish home for a while to stay in London. Stardom has also meant that she's had to cut down on Sweets, puddings, spaghetti — all the things she loves!</p>
