<p>Scottish child singer Lena Zavaroni gained international attention at age 10 during a U.S. tour. Her managers, Phil and Dorothy Solomon, lamented strict UK labor laws limiting her performances and considered relocating her to Los Angeles. Concerned that vocal training might ruin her distinctive sound, they withheld lessons—despite risks to her voice’s longevity. A prior young star under their management, Neil Reed, had lost his voice within months. The Solomons hoped Lena’s voice would endure longer, believing girls’ voices are more resilient.</p>
<p>Note: The article incorrectly cites 1973 as the year Lena’s hit "Ma! He’s Making Eyes at Me" topped charts—it was in 1974. The reference to “Common Market charts” appears dubious; no such recognized charts are known to exist.</p>
