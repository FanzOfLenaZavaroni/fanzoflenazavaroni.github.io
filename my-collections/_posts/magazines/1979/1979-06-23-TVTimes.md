<p>This fashion feature from TVTimes, titled <strong>The Little Lena Look</strong> with the subtitle “For girls with big ideas in fashion,” appeared in the FAMILY SCENE section. It showcased four photographs of Lena Zavaroni, then aged 15, modeling youth-oriented outfits styled to reflect the trends of the mid-1970s.</p>
<p>Each image was numbered, with a corresponding list of clothing descriptions—detailing fabrics, cuts, and accessories—common to teen fashion spreads of the era.</p>
