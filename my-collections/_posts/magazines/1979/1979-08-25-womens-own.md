<p><strong>Lena Zavaroni,</strong> the little lady with a big voice who's now shaping up nicely as an all-round entertainer, tells us, "I have several different perfumes that I like to wear but I think my favourite is Estée."</p>
<p>Estée Lauder's Estée comes in two strengths — Super and lighter and more subtle, Daytime. The Super costs from £6.25 for a small purse spray to £34 for 30 cc perfume, while Daytime costs £9—£14.</p>

<blockquote>It’s unclear whether Lena and the other featured personalities knew their quotes would be used in a promotional context. Were they compensated for what now reads like product endorsement—or were their preferences repurposed without consent? In today’s media landscape, such practices would require transparency. But in 1979, the boundaries between editorial and advertising were far more fluid.</blockquote>
