<h2><strong>other</strong> people <strong>and their scents</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Lena Zavaroni,</strong> the little lady with a big voice who's now shaping up nicely as an all-round entertainer, tells us, "I have several different perfumes that I like to wear but I think my favourite is Estée."</p>
<p>Estée Lauder's Estée comes in two strengths — Super and lighter and more subtle, Daytime. The Super costs from £6.25 for a small purse spray to £34 for 30 cc perfume, while Daytime costs £9—£14.</p>
