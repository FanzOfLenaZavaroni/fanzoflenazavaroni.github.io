<blockquote>
<p>AFTER a series of recently completed deals, President Records is releasing new singles by Lena Zavaroni, Dorothy Squires, Kathy Kirby, and a live Troggs album recorded at the New York rock club Max's Kansas City.</p>
<p>Lena Zavaroni has been signed to President on an exclusive, worldwide contract, and her single, Roses And Rainbows (PT 492) is produced by Marvin Hamlisch. It will be featured in her own BBC 1 series which starts next month.</p>
<p>Dorothy Squires, who had a big hit My Way on President, returns to the label with We Clowns (PT 490); and Kathy Kirby has a new version of the Charles Aznavour hit She, retitled He (PT 491).</p>
<p>The Troggs album comes to President via a European licensing deal with the Max's Kansas City label and is the first of a series of albums recorded live at the New York venue.</p>
<p>â€¢ The David Soul single Fool For Love (Energy NRG 004) has been shown with the wrong distributor's code in the Airplay Action chart. Distribution is via President, not PolyGram.</p>
