<p>Soloman added: "We have high hopes for Danny Doyle who is currently number one in the Irish charts, and who guested on Pam Ayres recent TV series. The last three years with President have been very satisfactory, and there has always been a healthy relationship between the two companies â€” however I realised that artist's careers are very important and so CBS was the only company to go to. because it cares about building up people's careers." PLASTIC FANTASTIC Records has signed the reggae Venture label for UK distribution. The new deal is for three years and covers the whole catalogue". First three releases will be an album. Movin' On, by Tradition (PFULP 3001) and singles Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue by Aurora York (PFU 2003) and I Will, by Paulette Walker (PFU 2005).
