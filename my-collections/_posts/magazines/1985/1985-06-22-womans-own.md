<div class="CardItem split">
<p>n this heartfelt and deeply honest interview, Lena Zavaroni opens up about her years-long struggle with anorexia and bulimia, revealing how a need for control and the pressures of fame contributed to her decline. From childhood stardom to a profound identity crisis, Lena shares how her obsession with weight masked deeper emotional turmoil and isolation.</p>
<p>Now 21, Lena describes the turning point that came through psychiatric and homeopathic care, alongside the unwavering love of her parents, sister, and long-time agent Dorothy Solomons. She reflects on the healing power of acceptance—accepting her body, her emotions, and the unpredictability of life—as well as the role that performing continues to play in her recovery. With her comeback show in Blackpool on the horizon, Lena’s resilience, warmth, and candid spirit shine through.</p>
<p>Through it all, she hopes her story might help others and reminds us: "Maybe you'll fall flat on your face. But so be it. After all, nothing in the world can be worse than torturing yourself."</p>
