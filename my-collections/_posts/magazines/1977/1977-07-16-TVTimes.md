<p>A promotional panel in the 16 July 1977 Yorkshire edition of TVTimes highlights the launch of a new ITV variety show titled <strong>Hi! Summer</strong>. The programme features musical performances, comedy sketches, and filmed segments across Britain. Featured entertainers include Leslie Crowther, Lena Zavaroni, Carl Wayne, Pearly Gates, The Blondes, and The Fellas, with music by Alyn Ainsworth and his orchestra. Produced by London Weekend Television, the series was set to premiere on Sunday, 17 July 1977. While scheduling details appeared separately in the programme listings, promotional panels like this were likely consistent across regional editions.</p>
