<p>Summary based on the original article published on 30 July 1977.</p>
<p>Lena Zavaroni, now thirteen, has been a star for over four years, having gained fame at the young age of nine. Despite her success, she describes herself as shy and "terrible," which contrasts sharply with her impressive singing talent. Lena first captured the audience's attention with her performance of "Ma, He's Making Eyes At Me" on "Opportunity Knocks." Since then, she has traveled the world, performed with Frank Sinatra, and developed a keen interest in fashion.</p>

<p>Currently, Lena attends the Italia Conti Stage School in London, where she wears a grey school uniform during the week. She enjoys casual clothing, particularly baggy styles, and shares a home with a family that includes a girl her age and her tall brother, whose shirts they often borrow. Although she has mixed feelings about mini skirts, she appreciates the variety of stage outfits chosen by her manager, noting that she frequently outgrows them.</p>

<p>Lena has faced challenges with body image, having dieted excessively about eight months ago, which affected her energy levels. She candidly mentions the risk of becoming anorexic during this time, as she believed she was "too fat" and restricted her food intake significantly. Fortunately, she has since resumed eating and enjoys Chinese food, while also expressing a love for corn.</p>

<p>Fashion is a significant passion for Lena, especially shoes. She admits to having many pairs and often buys shoes impulsively without considering how they match her existing wardrobe. With a weekly allowance of Â£5.00, she now prioritizes saving for clothes rather than spending on trivial items.</p>

<p>While Lena enjoys shopping, she dislikes homework, most academic subjects, and ballet classes. She has grown weary of flying due to her extensive travel, likening it to a long bus ride. Despite the challenges of fame, she appreciates the opportunity to meet admired figures in the industry and enjoys the attention from fans, even if it can be intrusive at times.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The article featuring Lena Zavaroni at thirteen may have aimed to downplay her struggles with anorexia, which would later be confirmed when she was sixteen. While Lena discusses her challenges with body image and the risk of becoming anorexic, the overall tone of the article presents a more lighthearted view of her life and interests. This contrast raises concerns about the portrayal of her mental health, suggesting that the narrative may have been crafted to obscure the seriousness of her condition at such a young age.</p>
<p><a href="/1963-11-04-lena-zavaroni/#infobox23">On 8 November 1982</a>, a senior official at the London Psychiatric Clinic confirmed for the first time that Lena had anorexia nervosa. It was revealed that she had been struggling with the disorder since she was thirteen. This confirmation highlighted that her managers and parents had been hiding the truth, likely to protect Lena's public image. While the intention may have been to preserve her right to a private life, it also suggests that those close to her contributed to her struggles. The media's role in questioning her weight and size further complicates the narrative, as it reflects a broader issue of how young stars are treated in the public eye.</p>
