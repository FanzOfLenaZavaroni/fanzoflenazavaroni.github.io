  <div class="CardItem split">
    <p>This two-page feature included a full-page photo on page 10, with the article content appearing on page 11. The summary below focuses on the written portion only.</p>
    <p>Lena Zavaroni rose to fame at just eight years old, winning national attention with her remarkable voice and charm. Born in Rothesay, Scotland, she began performing with her parents by age six and quickly transitioned into stardom after her success on Opportunity Knocks. Despite her achievements and international tours, Lena faced the emotional challenge of growing up away from home while living in London.</p>
    <p>Though warmly welcomed by her agent’s family, Lena remained deeply homesick. Her quick wit and engaging personality often masked the difficulties of balancing school, work, and social life. Despite moments of doubt, she continued to pursue her passion for performing—hoping for more time with family and a future shaped on her own terms.</p>
