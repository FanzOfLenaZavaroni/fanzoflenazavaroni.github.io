<p>After all the problems and heartache, Lena Zavaroni is happy, in love — and eating heartily again!</p>
<ul>
<li>That’s the headline from <span class="source">Women's Own</span>, 2 May 1978. The full article from page 8 isn’t available to me, so I can only reflect on what this title implies.</li>
<li>Later in life, Lena said she never loved Peter Wiltshire and only married him “to feel normal.” That casts doubt on the magazine’s portrayal and shows how easily a public narrative can be built on assumptions or wishful thinking.</li>
<li>Without access to the full article, I can’t know how much of Lena’s voice was present. What I do know is that her struggles—especially with her eating disorder—didn’t end with a romantic headline. The fantasy of Lena as fully recovered and fulfilled was just that: a fantasy.</li>
