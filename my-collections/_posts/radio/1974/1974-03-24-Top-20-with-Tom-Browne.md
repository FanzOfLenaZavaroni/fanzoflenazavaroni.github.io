<p>As the BBC dropped the Top 60 it meant this was the last time we would hear Lena's single in their Sunday Charts show as while she would remain in the Top 60 for another 4 weeks her position in the charts would be outside of the Top 20.</p>

<h2  id="infobox4"><a href="#infobox4">Differences In Dates</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>As can be seen the BBC seems to broadcast a week behind the dates given by the UK Official Singles Charts.</p>
<p>I imagine that is because the programme is broadcast on a Sunday and they would not receive the data for the charts until sometime during the week.</p>

<h2  id="infobox5"><a href="#infobox5">Medium Wave (AM) - VHF (FM)</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
At the time of broadcast Radio 1 was only available on Medium Wave so when the BBC broadcasted some of its music programmes it also broadcasted them on Radio 2 VHF so that listeners with a VHF Radio could enjoy a higher quality of sound and if the receiver was a stereo one than could enjoy tracks that were made in stereo as they should have been heard.
