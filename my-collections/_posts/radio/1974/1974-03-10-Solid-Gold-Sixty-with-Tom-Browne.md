<p>As can be seen the BBC seems to broadcast a week behind the dates given by the UK Official Singles Charts.</p>
<p>I imagine that is because the programme is broadcast on a Sunday and they would not receive the data for the charts until sometime during the week.</p>

<h3 id="note-2"><a href="#note-2">Note On BBC Radio 2</a></h3>
<p>BBC Radio 2's first air date was on 30 September 1967 it was a replacement for the Light Programme it was transmitter on VHF using frequency modulation in 1973 a subcarrier was added to the transmission which allowed the broadcasting of content in stereo.</P>

<h3 id="am-fm"><a href="#am-fm">Am - FM</a></h3>
<p>At the time of broadcast Radio 1 was only available on Medium Wave so when the BBC broadcasted some of its music programmes it also broadcasted them on Radio 2 VHF so that listeners with a VHF Radio could enjoy a higher quality of sound and if the receiver was a stereo one than could enjoy tracks that were made in stereo as they should have been heard.</p>
