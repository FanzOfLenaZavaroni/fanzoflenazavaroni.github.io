<h2  id="infobox5"><a href="#infobox5">Differences In Dates</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>As can be seen the BBC seems to broadcast a week behind the dates given by the UK Official Singles Charts.</p>
<p>I imagine that is because the programme is broadcast on a Sunday and they would not receive the data for the charts until sometime during the week.</p>

<h2  id="infobox6"><a href="#infobox6">Medium Wave (AM) - VHF (FM)</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
At the time of broadcast Radio 1 was only available on Medium Wave so when the BBC broadcasted some of its music programmes it also broadcasted them on Radio 2 VHF so that listeners with a VHF Radio could enjoy a higher quality of sound and if the receiver was a stereo one than could enjoy tracks that were made in stereo as they should have been heard.
