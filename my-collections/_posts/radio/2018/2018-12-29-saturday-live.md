<tr><td colspan="3"><blockquote>
<p>Aasmah Mir and Richard Coles are joined by Gabrielle, THE pop star of the 90s – inspiring lyrics, cool image, intriguing eye patch, hit after hit, and then she went quiet.</p>
<p>After time out as a mum of two she has just released her first album for 11 years, and she is back.</p>
<p>Will Farmer’s life seems only to exist on a summer’s day surrounded by beautiful objects in the garden of an English stately home, for he is an expert on Antiques Roadshow. He’s joining us in the midst of winter to talk about auctioneering and his passion for the past.</p>
<p>Emma Rosen spent a year trying 25 careers before turning 25 including: archaeology in Transylvania; being an extra in a major movie; alpaca farming in Cornwall and assisting a crisis team during the terror attack on Parliament in March 2017. Emma now works as a writer and speaker, focusing on millennials in the workforce.</p>
<p>Saturday Live listener Gary Horrocks joins us to talk about being a fan of Judy Garland – he heads the international fan club.</p>
<p>JP meets Philip Pittack and Martin White who run the last surviving Spitalfields cloth merchants.</p>
<p>and Brian Conley tells us his inheritance tracks. He chooses Elvis Presley performing Jailhouse Rock and Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons performing Who Loves You.</p>
