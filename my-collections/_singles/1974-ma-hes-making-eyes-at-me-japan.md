<p><strong>The Sound of World-Class Art – Philips</strong></p>

<p><strong>“Mama, Is This Love?” / “Rock-A-Bye Your Baby”</strong><br>
Catalogue Number: SFL-1850<br>
Durations: 2:25 / 2:37</p>

<p><strong>Note on Title:</strong> The Japanese flyer refers to the A-side as 「ママ、恋かしら」, which translates roughly as “Mama, Is This Love?” This localized title was used for the Japanese market. The original English title of the song is “Ma! (He’s Making Eyes At Me),” which is how it was released in the UK and internationally.</p>

<p><strong>Lena Zavaroni – The Precocious Angel Born in the UK</strong></p>

<p>In January 1974, a charming young girl made her dazzling debut in the UK. Through popular television programs, her powerful voice and expressive gestures—surprising for someone so small—captivated audiences. Her mature and dynamic singing style quickly made her a household name.</p>

<p>Demand for her debut record skyrocketed, and it sold out almost instantly. Due to the global oil crisis and electricity restrictions at the time, additional pressings couldn’t be produced fast enough. As a result, her UK label, Phonogram, had to request pressing support from France—an episode that speaks to the explosive popularity of this release.</p>

<p><strong>About Lena:</strong></p>

<p>Lena Zavaroni is a 10-year-old girl born to Italian-Scottish parents. Her mother was an amateur singer, and her father a musician, so she inherited a rich musical talent. From a young age, she sang at churches and public gatherings, quickly becoming a local favorite.</p>

<p>Record producer Tommy Scott and manager Philip Solomon—who also helped launch child star Neil Reid—were so impressed by Lena’s talent that they moved forward with her debut with full confidence.</p>

<p><strong>Side A: “Ma! (He’s Making Eyes At Me)”</strong></p>

<p>Originally published in 1921, this nostalgic Western melody was written by Sidney Clare and Con Conrad as the theme for a musical. It’s a perfect match for Lena, the “precocious angel,” as she sings about the joy of falling in love and confiding in her mother.</p>

<p><strong>Side B: “Rock-A-Bye Your Baby With A Dixie Melody”</strong></p>

<p>Written by Sam M. Lewis, Joe Young, and Jean Schwartz in 1918, this classic is even older than the A-side. It’s a standard famously performed by Al Jolson and remains beloved to this day.</p>

<p><strong>Lyrics (Excerpt – “Ma! (He’s Making Eyes At Me)”):</strong></p>

<p>Mama, he’s making eyes at me!<br>
Mama, he’s awfully nice to me!<br>
Mama, he’s almost breaking my heart — he’s beside me…<br>
God! Mama, let my conscience guide me!<br>
Mama, he wants to marry me. Be my honey bee.<br>
Every minute he gets bolder, now he’s leaning on my shoulder…<br>
Mama, he’s kissing me!</p>

<p><strong>Japanese Translation (Excerpt):</strong></p>

<p>Mama, he’s staring at me.<br>
Mama, he’s so kind to me.<br>
When I’m near him, my heart feels like it’s going to burst.<br>
God, please guide me!<br>
Mama, he wants to marry me.<br>
He’s getting bolder… now he’s leaning on my shoulder…<br>
Mama, he’s trying to kiss me!</p>
