<p>She went on to have her own TV shows. She also travelled the world and despite not being a recording artist released a number of albums and singles.</p>

<p>We can never know the true story of Lena Zavaroni's life as it seems to be a closed subject.</p>

<p>The best we can do is try and build up a view based on the information covered by the media and the public comments made by Lena, her family and friends. This is why I define the Biography on this website as a Media Based Biography of Lena Zavaroni.</p>

<p>It is presented as a series of short notes and comments along with links to related media, blogs, etc. I hope fans will find it of interest and that it helps them on their own discovery of Lena Zavaroni. It's a hard but sometimes happy but also very sad journey into the world of Lena Zavaroni. If you want the fantasy Lena that some fans seem to, then you should end your journey here.</p>

    <p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong>Update:</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: left; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 600px;">
        I am currently transitioning from using HTML's &lt;table&gt; tag to the &lt;div&gt; tag for creating cards.<br>
        <strong>Better Mobile Display:</strong> Tables may look fine on desktops, but they can become messy on small mobile devices. The card format will display correctly on all devices.<br>
        This transition will take some time. You might notice:
    </p>
    <ul style="text-align: left; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 600px;">
        <li>Some pages using the new card format.</li>
        <li>Other pages still using tables.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="text-align: left; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 600px;">
        I have changed the submenus from tables to a button format. You may see a mix of tables and buttons until I can rewrite all the code.
    </p>

    <p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong>Note:</strong></p>
    <ul style="text-align: left; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 600px;">
        <li>I am still figuring out the best approach for the submenu buttons.</li>
        <li>I might explore alternatives that do not use tables or buttons.</li>
        <li>Thereâ€™s also a possibility of removing the submenus, as they were added to help visitors navigate to different parts of the same page, but I feel they have added clutter to pages that have them.</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: left; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 600px;">Page with the table layout which I need to remove because as I said can become messy on mobile devices: <a href="1982-06-01-lena">Lena - Episode 3.2.</a></p>
    <p style="text-align: left; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 600px;">Page updated to using the card layout while I like the card layout I think you will see why I  am not too happy on the buttons for navaging around the page: <a href="/1982-05-25-lena">Lena - Episode 3.1.</a></p>
<p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong>Note:</strong></p><p style="text-align: left; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 600px;">As I had adjusted the button sizes 3 times to make sure I get 3 in a row as depending on the device I viewed the page on meant I was getting a mix of buttons on a row which just looked a mess and for all I know may still be messy on devices I am unable to test. So I may go away from providing  submenus anchor links, and or related pages, as it looks like a mess. As visitors will see the posts on their related OnThisDay or via the Post link in the main menu, it is not as if they can't find every page. I may look into using the Liquid templating language to create pages for each of the main categories, for example the TV series "Lena" have a category page that will  only list all the episodes of "Lena" that way I can have a single link on a page that would take a visior to a page that lists all epiosdes. I will look at that as an option, once I get some sleep. I should had be a sleep ages ago but always have trubble sleep and when I have something on my mind I have no charge of getting to sleep. Now I have some idea of how remove the buttons which I really do not like and have a single link instead, hopeful my brain will shut up and let me get some sleep. You can tell I am sleep as I am just going on. Hope fully the remove of all submenus will be a quick fix as it is only a case of deleting them. like updating fromtable to cards if I can create singke catagory pages that will take longer as to this notice once I get the work under way I will delete most of it and any comments get left they will be delted occe things get sort but know I now have a script I use to back up comments so I will aways have them and unlike in the past where I lost comments becuase of a system crash that should not happ now that I have a script to back up all comments left plus my own comments. Think I covered everything so of to bed.</p>
