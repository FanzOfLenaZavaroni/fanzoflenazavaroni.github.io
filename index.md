<p>She went on to have her own TV shows. She also travelled the world and despite not being a recording artist released a number of albums and singles.</p>

<p>We can never know the true story of Lena Zavaroni's life as it seems to be a closed subject.</p>
<p>The best we can do is try and build up a view based on the information covered by the media and the public comments made by Lena, her family and friends. This is why I define the Biography on this website as a Media Based Biography of Lena Zavaroni.</p>
<p>It is presented as a series of short notes and comments along with links to related media, blogs, etc. I hope fans will find it of interest and that it helps them on their own discovery of Lena Zavaroni. It's a hard but sometimes happy but also very sad journey into the world of Lena Zavaroni. If you want the fantasy Lena that some fans seem to, then you should end your journey here.</p>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong>Update:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 600px;">
I am currently transitioning from using HTML's &lt;table&gt; tag to the &lt;div&gt; tag for creating cards.<br>
<strong>Better Mobile Display:</strong> Tables may look fine on desktops, but they can become messy on small mobile devices. The card format will display correctly on all devices.<br>
This transition will take some time. You might notice:
</p>
<ul style="text-align: left; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 600px;">
<li>Some pages using the new card format.</li>
<li>Other pages still using tables for now.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 600px;">
<p><s>I have changed the submenus from tables to a button format. You may see a mix of tables and buttons until I can rewrite all the code.</s></p>
<p>I have replaced the submenu buttons with a card with a single catergory link, The card may have other links but usualy only one catergory link.</p>
</p>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 600px;">Page with the table layout which I need to remove because as I said can become messy on mobile devices: <a href="/1982-06-08-lena" style="color: #dc3545; font-weight: bold;">Lena - Episode 3.3</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 600px;">Page updated to using the card layout with a link card that give a link to single catorgory page <a href="/1982-05-25-lena/#infobox4" style="color: #dc3545; font-weight: bold;">Lena - Episode 3.1</a>.</p>
