<div id="myDIV">
<ul>
<li>—— (<span id="age"></span> years ago). The Stage and Television Today featured an article reporting on a civil reception held in Birmingham to mark the end of the run of the Babes in the Wood pantomime at the city's Alexandra Theater.
<ul>
<li>—— (Note). Current research suggests that this article was not featured in The Stage and Television Today at least not on the current date it can't be an earlier date as the pantomime would have still been running and a later date would be unlikely so that means it was another paper or that the article may not have been written or published at all.</li>
<li>—— (Note). The comments below dated March 2021 are related to this questionable information.</li></ul></li>
